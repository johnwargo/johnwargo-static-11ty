# Changelog

## 20240107

Updated the stats plugin so it ignores the current year (the last yeally, making some assumptions) in the avgPostsPerYear calculation. Updated the graph on the stats page so it omits the last year stat (Site Average Posts/Year) on the graph. 

## 20240106

Migrated from Netlify Functions to Google Functions to avoid publishing my Google Analytics API key with the site.
