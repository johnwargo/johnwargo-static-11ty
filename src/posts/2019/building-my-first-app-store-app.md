For the last few months, I've been working on my first app in smartphone app stores. I had an idea in my head for a few years now, and I finally got around to building the app. I'm fascinated by [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/){target="_blank"}, and learning Ionic 4 got me started with this app.

The app's feature complete (although there's one small issue with the splashscreen), so I'm working on the company and app web sites before publishing the app to the stores.
