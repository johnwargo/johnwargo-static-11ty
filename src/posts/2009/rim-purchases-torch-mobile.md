Interesting that [Torch Mobile announced today](https://torchmobile.com/){target="_blank"} that they were purchased by RIM (and RIM didn't announce it).

There have been a lot of articles lately on the Web about how RIM's going to update the browser to match industry standards and I guess we now know. I'm curious to how this is going to work - I've always heard that WebKit was based on C, not sure how easy it's going to be to do a full port to Java so it will run on the BlackBerry. Only time will tell and I can't wait to see.
