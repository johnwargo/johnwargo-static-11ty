I received the Lotusphere schedule last week. I was very excited to see that our BP212 session was selected to be a repeat session - that's never happened to me before. Way cool.

Here's the schedule:

[BP212](https://www-950.ibm.com/events/wwe/lotus/lsph2010.nsf/sessionabstract?openform&sessionid=BP212){target="_blank"}: Tuesday from 3:30 PM to 4:30 PM

[AD114](https://www-950.ibm.com/events/wwe/lotus/lsph2010.nsf/sessionabstract?openform&sessionid=AD114){target="_blank"}: Wednesday from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM

[BP212 (repeat)](https://www-950.ibm.com/events/wwe/lotus/lsph2010.nsf/sessionabstract?openform&sessionid=BP212){target="_blank"}: Wednesday from 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM

Be sure to track me down and say hello!
