I found out last night thatÂ [BoxTone](http://www.boxtone.com){target="_blank"} (and I) had been selected to be a speaker (for two sessions) for the Midwest Lotus User Group Conference 2009 in Chicago at the end of August. I'll be speaking on two topics:

*   Preparing for the Mobile Applications Onslaught
*   Prepping for BlackBerry Enterprise Server v5: A Lotus Domino Upgrade Unlike Any Other

The mobile applications presentation I've given several times. I gave it at two of [BoxTone](http://www.boxtone.com){target="_blank"}'s [Mobile Professional Network](http://www.mobileprofessionalnetwork.org/){target="_blank"} meetings in NY and Atlanta.I also presented the topic at the [View Domino Admin conference](http://www.viewadmin2010.com/){target="_blank"} in Boston in April. It's a high energy discussion of why BlackBerry & system administrators fear mobile apps, what the real concerns should be and how to mitigate them.

The second topic is intended to help BlackBerry/Domino Administrators understand how to prepare their environments for the upgrade to BES 5.0 - which won't be too hard, but there's work that will need to be done.

Anyway, I'm excited about the event and I love to present technical topics. Please stop by and see me at the event if you attend.
