Received a simple phishing email today; this one's interesting because the scammers sending this email avoided many sophisticated ways to make this email look legitimate and simply pushed me to call a number where they'll supposedly help me resolve the issue. 

Here's the email:

<img src="src/images/2026/phishing-robinhood-withdrawal.png" alt="Robinhood Phising email" />

The message starts with:

> Verification Needed to Process Robinhood Withdrawal: SecID: XX5VW

Which would immediately get your attention if you happened to have a [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/){target="_blank"} account, I don't.

The message provides some information about the detected withdrawal attempt then asked me to call a number to "take action". The message contains no links except one to make it easy for the recipient to tap to call the company to ask them to block the withdrawal. 

The phone number listed is a Texas phone number, but they included the "+1" in the number which means they're targeting a user outside of the US (US customers wouldn't use a +1 prefix when dialing).

Notice too that they formatted the number like an international number with the last four digits split up into two parts. 

> +1 (210) 547-18-26 

Yeah, this definitely isn't a valid email, Robinhood would never send a message like this.

Another issue is, of course, the sender email. Its noreply at mma.com.br which is a wireless provider in Brasil.

Don't click on the link if you get this email.
