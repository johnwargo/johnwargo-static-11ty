While I sat around the house waiting for Winter Storm Fern to hit us, I decided to spend some time finishing a simple Windows application I started a while back; a simple Password Generator for Windows. 

Most modern browsers can generate and store site passwords for you, but every so often you need a password to use somewhere else but the browser. There are a bunch of free browser-based password generators available online, but I wanted something simple to use on my desktop PC in Microsoft Windows.

When you start the application, the application's main screen opens and it looks like the following:

Select the number of characters of the generated password (the password length) then select other options for the generated password. Click the **Generate** button to generate a new password using the options selected in the form.

When you select the **Special Characters** option, the generator uses the following characters:  \! \@ \# \$ \% \^ \& \* \( \) \? \> \< \/ \~ \` \: \; \+ \= \- \{ \} \[ \] \* \. \,

You can download the software for free from [Fumbly Diddle Software](https://fumblydiddle.com/products/passwordgenerator/){target="_blank"}.
