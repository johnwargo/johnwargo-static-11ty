title: Apache Cordova 4 Programming Site Retired
description: My Apache Cordova 4 Programming book came out years ago and Cordova's moved a long way from the version 4 covered in the book. In this post, I announce that I retired the book's landing page.

I shutdown the web site for my Apache Cordova 4 Programming book today. The book published way back in 2015, and Apache Cordova has evolved a lot since then.

You can still buy the book on Amazon and other places, but there's no longer the need for a promotional website for the publication. Don't worry, the code from the book is still up on [GitHub](https://github.com/johnwargo/ac4p){target="_blank"}.
