I can't think of any worse way to implement account profile editing than Axios does in their site today.

{% image "src/images/2023/axios-profile-edit.png", "Axios Account Profile Edit", "image-full" %}

Seriously? A separate edit link for every account profile property? That makes absolutely no sense. I'm setting up a new account, so I have to populate each of the fields on the form, so why force me to click edit for each and every one of them?

It just makes no sense.
