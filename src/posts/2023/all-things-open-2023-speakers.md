I was looking at the [All Things Open 2023 - First Round Speakers](https://2023.allthingsopen.org/round-1-speakers/){target="_blank"} page the other day and noticed my name and picture there, how cool is that?

Here's my speaker [profile](https://2023.allthingsopen.org/speakers/john-wargo/){target="_blank"}.  

I can't wait for the conference; this will be my third time presenting at this amazing conference.
