Tomorrow I'm presenting a session at All Things Open 2023. My session is called *Write Shell Scripts Using JavaScript and zx* and the session covers how to use Google's [zx](https://github.com/google/zx){target="_blank"} and [Execa](https://www.npmjs.com/package/execa){target="_blank"} to simplify JavaScript scripts that launch external processes.
