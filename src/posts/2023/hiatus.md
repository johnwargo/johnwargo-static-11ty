Taking a Hiatus

Beginning June 7th, 2023 I’ll disappear for a while and I’m not sure how long I’ll be gone. I’m having shoulder surgery and my arm will be immobilized for at least six weeks, perhaps more. My wife volunteered to type for me while I’m out of commission, so we’ll see if I can make that work if something comes up I want to write about.
