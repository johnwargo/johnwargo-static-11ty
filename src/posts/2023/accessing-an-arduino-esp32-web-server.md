In [Arduino ESP32 Web Server on a Processor Core](/posts/2023/arduino-esp32-web-server-on-a-processor-core/) I described how to code a web server and run it on a dedicated core in an Arduino ESP32 project. The article is very long, so I didn't show anything about how to connect to that web server, but I'll do that here. 

It is really easy to connect to this web server from another Arduino project or another small hardware device. You would think that since it's a web server that I'd be able to easily connect to it from any browser running on any device, but that's not true. There are several issues that limit your options, and I'll cover many of them in this post.

Here's a video of the web server project working with the mobile app.
