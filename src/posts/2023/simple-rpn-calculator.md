On my 18th birthday, my high school girlfriend gave me an Hewlett Packard 41CV calculator; I loved that thing. Owning it introduced me to [Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation){target="_blank"} as well as extensible computers. It wasn't a calculator, it was a programmable computer you could hold in your hand and I programmed the hell out of that thing. It allowed you to plugin modules, I think it had 4 slots and I had a whole bunch of modules. This thing was even something they used to calculation on the space shuttle: [Calculator, Hand-held, HP41](https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/calculator-hand-held-hp-41/nasm_A19890003000){target="_blank"}.

That particular device is long gone and I've burned through a couple of replacement devices over the years. I can use a traditional calculator, but I do much better with RPN-based ones. I've played around with the different RPN calculators on Android and iOS, but none of them meet my needs.  I have one on Android that's excellent, but so many of these app developers try too hard to mimic the layout and look of HP Calculators, so for this particular one, I can never seem to find the X<>Y button when I need it.

Anyway, I drew out a wireframe diagram of the app's UI (see below) and I've open sourced the code so you can follow along as I build this thing. No guarantees for when I'll finish this thing, but I have some time over the next few weeks to dedicate to this, so it may not be too long. You can find the code in [Simple RPN Calculator](https://github.com/fumblystuff/simple-rpn-calculator){target="_blank"}.

I'm writing the app using [Flutter](https://flutter.io){target="_blank"} for a variety of reasons:

1. I LOVE writing Flutter apps
2. Using Flutter allows me to deliver mobile apps as well as a web application. I can even build this thing for Windows and macOS so I can run the app anywhere.
3. Did I mention that I LOVE writing Flutter apps?

Stay tuned on this one, I'l share real app screen shots when I make real profgress.
