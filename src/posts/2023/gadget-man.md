Last summer we were on vacation with my wife’s family and when my wife started describing me as a gadget man, somehow someone started singing Rocket Man (by Elton John) using Gadget Man instead for the main theme for the song. We had a lot of fun singing the verses and belting out the chorus. 

I turned 60 last year and for my birthday my wife gathered my closest local friends together for a surprise party. There’s a lot more to tell about that particular event, but for now here’s what I wanted to write about now. 

In preparation for the party, she and a couple of neighbors wrote an actual Gadget Man song and serenaded me at the party. It was amazing fun and I have a video of it that I won’t share here, all you get are the lyrics my wife, sister in law, and friends put together for the event.

> He works for Or-a-cle – that’s his day job.
> He’s published books about software.
> And he loves the wor…..ld of  tech, my friend.
> 
> He loves his kids -- he loves his wife,
> And Dexter – that’s his pup.
> It’s such a fi….ne -- life for John.
>  
> But there’s something that he loves to find online
> That feeds a joy for him deep inside.
> We know the man who likes to share that joy,
> Oh yeah, yeah, yeah,
>  
> John’s the Gadget M..a..n
> Gadget Man – he knows where to find the coolest toys. 
>  
> And he always on the hunt for some new tool
> To keep or give away to those who find
> They need a m.a.n who will do the search
> Oh yeah, yeah, yeah…..
>  
> He’s the Gadget Man – Gadget Man - he knows where to find the coolest toys. 
>  
> So if you have a flat -- or lose your lights
> John’s got -- the perfect fix
>  
> Cause he’s the one to call  --  for emergencies.
>  
> He searches for -- the perfect tool
> To solve a problem -- just for you
>  
> Gadget m..a…n, Gadget man
> 
> But there’s something that he loves to find online
> That feeds a joy for him deep inside.
> We know the man who likes to share those toys,
> Oh yeah, yeah, yeah,
>  
> John’s the Gadget Man
> Gadget Man – he knows where to find the coolest toys. 
>  
> Gets his kicks by finding tools that fix
> 
> Helping out gives him lots of joy
>  
> He knows where to find the coolest toys.  

It’s an amazing song and it was an amazing night. I’m so happy to have a wife and friends that know you well enough to make fun of you in a song.
