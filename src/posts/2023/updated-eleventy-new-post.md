When I published my [Eleventy New Post](https://npmjs.com/package/eleventy-new-post){target="_blank"} package, it only supported selecting a single post category. That approach was fine for a while, but I noticed that I started assigning multiple categories to posts recently and the utility wasn't helping me as much as it could.

I had some extra time on my hands today, so I decided to update the utility to allow selection of multiple categories. Here's an image of the updated version in action.

Let me know if you find the utility useful.
