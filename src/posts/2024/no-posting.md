Wow, no posts from me in a while. I apologize for that, but I've been spending a lot of time in my workshop making sawdust, and I've not had much I wanted to blog about. 

I noticed that I had some issues completing projects in my shop, so I spent two solid months there finishing up some projects. I did a lot of cool stuff and solidified a lot of my skills (along with buying a lot of new tools - don't tell my wife).
