I don't understand some of the connection requests I get on LinkedIn. I received one today that reads:

> John Hi! Judging from your LinkedIn profile, you have achieved a lot in your field of work. I hope we can chat, and I look forward to our conversation!

{% image "src/images/2024/linkedin-connection-liu.png", "Connection message", "image-full" %}

Now, my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmwargo/){target="_blank"} clearly states:

> I restrict my LinkedIn connections to people I know, and have worked with professionally; if I do not know you, I will not accept your connection invitation.

Which means, I'm fairly certain, that I won't accept random connection requests unless, of course, I actually know the person requesting the connection. 

Digging deeper, I see that the requesting person has the following description in their LinkedIn profile:

> LP is engaged in freelancer. Started clothing, skin restoration, established clothing company, involved in wine, real estate, horse farm investment

LP? I thought the connection request was from Anna Liu.

On top of that: Clothing? Skin Restoration? Wine? Real estate? Horse farm investment? Why would I be interested in any of that considering what's in my LinkedIn profile today? I just don't get it.

Looking at their profile, it was created in 2013, but never posted anything to their profile in all those 11 years.

I assume this is some sort of scam, but I can't figure it out. Some sort of franchise opportunity? A recruiter? Who knows, I declined the invitation, so I guess I'll never know.
