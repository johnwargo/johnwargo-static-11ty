Google recently started asking for ID verification for Play Store developers. The time came for me to submit mine and I dutifully submitted both a scan of my passport as well as a scan of my driver's license (both sides). Google, of course, repeatedly failed the verification process without telling me anything about what was wrong with my submission.

After failing a couple of times, I finally responded to one of the emails I received on this topic asking what the issue was. Only then did I learn that their issue was that I'd uploaded a black and white scan of my Driver's License. 

{% image "src/images/2024/google-id-verification.png", "", "image-full" %}

I don't know why I scanned it in black and white, but I did and that's why they wouldn't accept it. 

How silly. They're telling me they wanted proof of my address and the ID does that, who cares if it's in black and white?

Now, of course I could have [read the instructions](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10788890){target="_blank"} but even those don't help. The instructions say that you must:

+ Accurately provide your developer account information, including the following details:
  + Legal name and address
  + D-U-N-S number, if registering as an organization
  + Contact email address and phone number
  + Developer email address and phone number shown on Google Play where applicable
  + Payment methods where applicable
  + Google payment profile linked to your developer account

It doesn't mention anything about needing to upload a copy of your driver license nor does it say that the uploaded image must be in color. 

Nothing like wasting my time.
