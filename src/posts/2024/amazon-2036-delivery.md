Imagine my surprise when I received an email from Amazon letting me know that an album I purchased a while ago, ([Opeth's Last Will and Testament](https://www.amazon.com/LAST-WILL-TESTAMENT-OPETH/dp/B0DBSY58RZ){target="_blank"}), wouldn't be delivered until 2036.

The album was due earlier in the year, but the band recently announced it was delayed to November 22nd in 2024.  I'm truly curious what would delay the album 12 more years. Any ideas?  I'm not sure I want to wait that long to hear their new music.
