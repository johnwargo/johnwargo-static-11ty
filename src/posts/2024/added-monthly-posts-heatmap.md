I added a Posts per Month array to the [Eleventy Post Stats plugin](https://github.com/johnwargo/eleventy-plugin-post-stats){target="_blank"} today. This allowed me to add a posts per month heatmap to the site's [Statistics](/about/statistics/){target="_blank"} page. Its fun to see where I was busy on the site and when I published nothing.
