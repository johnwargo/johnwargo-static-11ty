In [Postal Scam Urtye dot com](/posts/2024/scam-postal-urtye/), I pointed out a lot of different ways you can easily tell when a text message you receive is crap. I received a lot more of those types of text messages lately and it's fun to watch them evolve.

Here's a screen shot of one I received the other day:

{% image "src/images/2024/spam-postal-svc-20241121.png", "Spam Text Message", "image-full" %}

A couple of things are different. Most importantly the phone number is a US Phone number (Michigan), which at least makes some sense. Most of these I get are International phone numbers which, of course, the US Postal Service would NEVER use to send me a text message.

{% sidebar "International Phone Number?" %}
The US Postal Service (USPS) won't use an international phone number to send text notifications to US customers. It simply makes no sense. So, if a text message you receive supposedly from USPS and the sender's phone number begins with a plus sign and a two digit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_country_calling_codes" target="_blank">country code</a>, then it is most likely junk/phishing/scam. Since the US created the telephone system text messaging is based on, our country code is +1, anything else is not a US phone number.
{% endsidebar %}

Here's the content of the message so people can easily search on it:

> USPS Notification: Your package could not be delivered due to incomplete address information. Please correct your address within the next 48 hours at this link: << Link >> to avoid it being returned. We will redeliver within 24 hours once updated. Have a fantastic day full of peace and success, from the USPS team!

My most favorite part of this scam message is the "Have a fantastic day full of peace and success, from the USPS team!" Right, like the US Postal Service is going to wish me peace and success. [ROFL](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/rofl){target="_blank"}.
