A few weeks before the 2024 election, I suspended my campaign for president. I didn't want to keep votes from the candidate I wanted to win. I'm getting ready to delete the web site for my campaign but I thought I'd share with you links to the campaign store in case you want to pick up any Wargo 2024 branded items as a form of protest against our political system. 

Here's links to the two stores:
