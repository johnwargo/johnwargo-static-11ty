I noticed lately that FedEx seems incapable of knowing where packages are in their delivery network. As an example, take a look at the following screen shot taken this morning:

This particular package shipped on March first from Strongsville, OH. It traveled through FedEx's shipping network to Charlotte (where I live), arriving in the delivery city the next day (Saturday, March 2nd). The package sat there for a few days, in the delivery city mind you, before FedEx shipped it to a small town outside of Charleston SC. Then it made its way to Spartanburg, back to Charlotte and was supposed to be delivered but never made it on the truck.

That little package had quite a trip across the Carolinas.

So it was out for delivery yesterday and its supposedly out for delivery yet again today, but look at the scheduled delivery date. Even though it's out for delivery today, FedEx expects that it will somehow not deliver until tomorrow?

WTF?

I thought FedEx was the tightest ship in the shipping business? What happened to their IT capabilities that it no longer knows where to take packages and when it can deliver them?
