title: Generating Post Descriptions Redux
description: I recently published a post about 3D printing but forgot to set a
  description. Luckily, I used the Describer GenAI extension for Visual Studio
  Code to quickly generate a description for me. It only took a few clicks and
  seconds to add a nice description to the post before publishing it.

I just finished publishing the previous post (about 3D printing) and realized I forgot to set a description for the post. Being rather lazy and remembering that I have a [Describer GenAI](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=john-wargo.describer-genai){target="_blank"} extension for Visual Studio Code, I decided to let GenAI set the description for that post. 

A couple of clicks later, VSCode added a nice description to the post and I published it. It only took seconds, and I'm fairly happy with the results.
