Adter [my most recent post](/posts/2024/added-folder-selection-new-post/){target="_blank"} I realized I needed another enhancement to my [Eleventy New Post](https://github.com/johnwargo/eleventy-new-post){target="_blank"} utility.

Still working in the Eleventy-based docs site, I realized that I wouldn't use Categories on that site like I do on others. For this site, I'm hard coding navigation and there's no reason to arbitrarily group posts in that case. Anyway, the new version is up there, please let me know what you think about it and if you have any feature suggestions.
