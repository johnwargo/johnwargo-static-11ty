description: I deleted my Zinio account and that kicked off a ridiculous series of steps beyond what I expected. How hard does it need to be to delete an online account you no longer use?

I created a [Zinio](https://zinio.com/){target="_blank"} account many years ago (many, many years ago). Online magazines was a thing then and there were a couple of magazines I was interested in that had moved to the platform. I stopped reading those magazines years ago and completely forgot about my account. 

I was bored the other day and I was poking around on my tablet. I suddenly remembered my Zinio account and opened the browser to see if it was still a thing. I found it, logged in, and browsed all of my magazines (going back into the early 2000's).  None of that interested me anymore and I'm not interested in reading magazines online, so I looked for the link or button to delete my account. I quickly found it and clicked it, but what happened next was just ridiculous.

A few minutes later, I received an email from them acknowledging the deletion request:
 
> We have received delete me request for the following user Email: john@myemail.com, User ID: some_long_account_id. Please follow the legal process to confirm receipt of this request and follow the legal delete me process as required by the law. FYI this needs to be actioned by the Data Controller and Data Processor. 

Legal process? What legal process? Data Controller? Data Processor?  I know what those things are, but how exactly do they apply here?  Zinio is the data controller, wherever they host their application platform is the data processor. I'm not involved in either.

A short while later, I received another email from them:

Holy crap, seriously? Dude, all I'm trying to do is delete an account I haven't used in almost a decade.

I logged into my Zinio account using my Zinio account credentials and followed the process to request an account deletion. Why are you emailing me about legal issues? Just do it and be done with it.

I didn't make a request for deletion of personal data, all I asked you to do is delete my account. If you want to hang onto the data after you delete the account, I truly don't care.  Well, that's not true - I do care if they leak my data, but I don't care if they want to keep it around at their expense.

Nope, they weren't done yet.

Data privacy request? I didn't make a data privacy request.

Anyway, the account's deleted (I think) as I haven't received any emails from them in a while, but boy did they take this request way more seriously than I did. What happened here was either that very scared lawyers involved themselves in what is essentially a very simple process or some consulting firm suggested all of these additional layers of fear in order to get more billable revenue from Zinio. Either way, they were clearly duped.
