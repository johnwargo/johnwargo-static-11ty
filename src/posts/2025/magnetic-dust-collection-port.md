Dust collection is a pretty big problem in my workshop; I've ignored it for a long time, but I decided I had to do something about it. My router table has built-in dust collection under the table and in the fence, but if I'm not using the fence, I make quite a mess in my workshop.

Lately, my friend Scott and I traded technology favors, I make 3D prints of his car parts and he designs cool stuff for my workshop. One of the things I asked him to design for me was a dust port I could use on my table saw and on my router table with the fence removed.

Here's what he came up with:

Its a PLA dust port with a connector on the backside for the hose from my dust collector. The best part of it though is that it uses two of those rare earth magnets to hold the dust collection port to the cast iron top of my router table (and table saw).

Those yellow and black parts connected to the dust port hold the rare earth magnets. When you twist the black knobs, the magnets lower to the base of the unit and make a magnetic connection to the iron tool top.

Here's the underside of the magnet thingies; they sit flat on the table top, but when you twist the knobs, the rare earth magnets lower to make contact with those bottom plates. When that happens, it's locked to the table top and requires about 55 pounds of effort to move it. Enough strength to hold it in place while I cut something.

Here it is attached to the top of my router table.

To remove it, simply twist the knobs in the opposite direction and it disconnects from the table.

The magnet thingies I used for this project are the [Magswitch MagJig 60 Magnetic Woodworking and Welding Base Clamp Holder for Wood Working Supplies, Accessories, Tools and Equipment, Magnet Switch with On/Off Capabilities, 55 lb Holding Force](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00S8J0E9C?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1){target="_blank"}. There's a lot of different options out there, but these were the righty size, price, and strength for my needs.

Enjoy!
