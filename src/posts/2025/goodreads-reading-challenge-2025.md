I checked out my Goodreads Reading Challenge statistics for 2025 and I did quite well against my goal this year. I've been working through all of my old books I've had lying around and trying to minimize new book purchases (with little success). If I read in 2026 like I did in 2025 (and previous years), I should be able to get through most of them next year.
