Over the years, I created several apps that solve a particular problem I had. The first was the [Goodreads Page Adjuster](https://goodreads-page-adjuster.netlify.app/){target="_blank"} and most recently the [Cert2Arduino](https://cert2arduino.netlify.app/){target="_blank"} app. When I published a simple service to use with my [ESP32 HTTPS Client Request with JSON Body](https://github.com/johnwargo/https-client-esp32-json-body){target="_blank"}, I decided to publish a demo site visitors could use to try out the service as they worked on their related Arduino or ESP32 sketch. 

The site is [John Wargo's Apps and Demos](https://jmwdemos.netlify.app/){target="_blank"}, and it looks like this:

As I create more public facing apps and demos, I'll update the site to reference them.
