Back in the middle of 2019, I published my last book: **Learning Progressive Web Apps**. It was probably my most mainstream book, a book about web development rather than my highly focused books on mobile development for PhoneGap and BlackBerry. I was really proud of that book, it was just the right length and the publisher printed it in color which made the content more interesting.

After a little more than 6 years on the market, I decided to let the learningpwa.com domain registration expire and dismantle the site. The site gets very little traffic and it been a long time since I heard from a reader. You can still find the book's source code at [learning-pwa-code](https://github.com/johnwargo/learning-pwa-code){target="_blank"} and can ask questions in the repo.
