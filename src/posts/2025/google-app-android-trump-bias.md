I carry an Android phone, I always have; even when I worked for AT&T and had to carry an iPhone, my personal device was always an Android phone. One of the features I like on Android is the news feed in the Google app, the screen you get when you swipe left from the home screen. 

Google populates this screen using news topics it knows I'm interested in or, at least, it things I'm interested in. Generally it gets it right, but it also allows me to tune the feed, select topics I'm not interested in seeing in my feed.

Since the last Presidential election its showing me stuff I'm not interested in and the tuning options it offers me won't let me block posts I'm not interested in. For example, before the election, I monitored a lot of US National news which included a lot of political stuff. I truly care about what's going on here. Since the election, not so much. I'm burying my head in the sand hoping I can survive the next three years or so by not paying attention to American Politics.

However, the Google App on Android refuses to allow me to block content related to President Trump. I can block other topics, sites, etc, but even though our president's name is the first word in the article title in the following example, the app doesn't offer it as a topic to block.

This is absolutely ridiculous, why can I block Zelenskyy and Putin, but not Trump? Especially since Trump is the most prominent name in the article?  I'm actually interested in what Zelenskyy and Putin do, but not Trump, but the Google App deliberately blocks me from blocking Trump. This makes no sense.

This seems like deliberate bias, Google's afraid of incurring Trump's wrath, so they omit Trump from any blocking options. Please Google, be fair - if you're going to allow me to block some people in my feed based on mentions in an article, allow me to block any people mentioned in the article. Or, at least all people mentioned in the article title. To deliberately omit the most prominent name in the article title is disingenuous.
