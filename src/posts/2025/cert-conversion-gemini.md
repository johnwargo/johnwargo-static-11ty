I was playing around in Google last night checking to see if my post on Arduino ESP32 connections using HTTPS ([Arduino ESP32 Connect Using HTTPS](/posts/2025/arduino-esp32-connect-https/){target="_blank"}) was in the search results. It wasn't, but the Certificate to Arduino announcement ([Automated Public Cert to Arduino Header Conversion](/posts/2025/public-cert-arduino/){target="_blank"}) post did make it into Google Gemini. 

Here's the generative API results for a search on "Convert Certificate Arduino":

It was fun to see how quickly that made it into generative AI.
