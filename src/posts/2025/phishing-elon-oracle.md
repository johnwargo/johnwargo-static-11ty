An interesting email showed up in my inbox this morning. Interesting because it appears to be from Oracle (and I work for Oracle) but there's a whole bunch of weirdness about the message. Take a look, here's the message:

<img src="/images/2025/phishing-oracle-elon.png" alt="Phishing email that looks like it's from Oracle" />

Like I said, there's a lot of weirdness in this one:

1. The message says its from elonElectronlcDevlce 9O%ElectrlcReduction which is simply nonsense. Notice how they replaced i's with l's everywhere in the Sender? Weird, right? They're trying to say "Elon Electronic Device 90% Electric Reduction", but deliberately didn't for some reason.
2. The sent from address is oracle-acct_ww@oracle.com which is in a valid email format and may actually be a real Oracle email address (I'm not going to check).
3. Even if Oracle did send the email, they didn't, they wouldn't be sending me an email about Elon Musk.
4. The Learn More link points to a myshopify.com address. 
5. All of the images on the page as well as the footer links all relate to Google Analytics. 

{% sidebar "Definitely Fraudulent" %}
This message is definitely junk and I wouldn't click on any links in the message nor would I let the mail client download any images from the message.
{% endsidebar %}

What makes me wonder is the oracle.com part of this. Is this a targeted email because the hackers, spammers, or phishermen know I work at Oracle?  Or is that just coincidence. I have no idea.
