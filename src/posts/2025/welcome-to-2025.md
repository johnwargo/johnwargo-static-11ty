Its the first day of 2025 and I thought I'd start things off a little differently this year. This post is both a retrospective on last year's activities and a look into the future of this site (at least for this year).

## Retrospective

Last year I wrote slightly less posts than the previous year (59 vs. 68). One of the reasons for so many articles in 2023 was that I migrated a lot of sites to Eleventy that year (from Joomla! and Wordpress) so I had a lot to write about. 

In 2024:

* I wrote a lot more posts about spam and [phishing](https://johnwargo.com/categories/phishing/){target="_blank"} emails and text messages I received.
* I wrote a lot more posts about [Eleventy(11ty)](https://johnwargo.com/categories/eleventy/){target="_blank"}, including adding some new capabilities to existing utilities.
* I suspended my US Presidential campaign and decided not to run again.
* I spent a lot more time in my workshop than at my desk writing code, so that explains part of the deficit. 
* I released a [Path Backup (and Restore)](https://fumblydiddle.com/products/pathbackup/){target="_blank"} utility for Windows.
* I built a [documentation site](https://docs.fumblydiddle.com/){target="_blank"} using Docusaurus.

### Workshop Projects

Here's some of the projects I built last year:

A benchtop power supply with a 3D-printed case.

I made three Owl houses:

A cherry napkin holder:

A set of storage shelves for some jars full of nuts I had in my shop:

A new storage cabinet for the shop

A new stand, with amplifier and speakers, for Sparky, my remote control flame throwing pumpkin"

## Looking Forward

What does 2025 look like for me?

* I plan on doing even more woodworking in my shop; I'm honing my skills for retirement.
* I'm on track to eliminate the only debt I have (my mortgage) and get my kids moved out of the house.
* I may retire or start working part time (who knows)
* I plan on finishing this site's upgrade to Eleventy 3.  I figured it out and upgraded several sites, but upgrading this one is biting me in the ass.
* I bought a better 3D printer last year (a Bambu Labs X1C), so I plan on learning how to design my own projects for printing. 
* I'd like to add a newsletter to the site so people can subscribe to updates
* [Raymond Camden](https://www.raymondcamden.com/){target="_blank"} publishes periodic lists of links to things he's looking at, I may do that this year as well (that's the goal anyway).

That's all I have right now, see you soon
