I've been so busy since Lotusphere (ya, I know - that was months ago) that I never got around to letting all of you know that Kryos AppXtender shipped in February. If you haven't heard about AppXtender, it's pretty cool - it's a tool you can use to mobilize your existing Domino databases. The folks at Kryos asked me to be a bete tester for the platform and I really enjoyed working with it. I demonstrated the platform in my session at Lotusphere 2011 and published an article in [the View](https://eview.com){target="_blank"} that showed how it works - View subscribers can read the article [online](https://eview.com/eview/VOLR6.nsf/CurrentIssue/468658DD51A8C299852578170058DF66?OpenDocument){target="_blank"}.

When you get a chance, take a look at the [announcement](https://bit.ly/hR1hDR){target="_blank"}.
