I started working with [PhoneGap](https://phonegap.com){target="_blank"} today. I've been poking around the framework for a while now and I finally got around to actually working with it. As with most Open Source projects, I find that the documentation is sorely lacking.

I'm building a PhoneGap application that uses the Domino RESTful web service I documented in a previous article on this site (Mobilizing Domino Data Using REST: Part 1). I'll be using what I'm learning now in one of my sessions at the [View Domino Developer Conference](https://lotusdeveloper2011.com/){target="_blank"}. Stay tuned.
