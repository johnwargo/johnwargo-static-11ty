Lots going on here on the book front. Last week, my publisher and I agreed on a different title for my PhoneGap book. It's going to be called *PhoneGap Essentials*, and we even finally have a cover for the book as well.

We wrapped up the table of contents, a description of the book and my bio last week and it looks like everything got submitted to Amazon because it went on the [www.amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321814290){target="_blank"} site today for pre-order. You can access the book's page here: [PhoneGap Essentials](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321814290){target="_blank"}. Please use that link to pre-order the book since I make a little more money that way.

I'm working my way through the manuscript. I'm 155 pages into the book (out of about 220 total typed pages) and I have about 6 chapters to finish by the end of the year. I'm having a lot of fun writing this book and can't wait to hold it in my hands.
