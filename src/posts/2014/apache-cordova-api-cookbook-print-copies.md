Print copies of *Apache Cordova API Cookbook* arrived on Friday; my expectation is that they will be available for shipment from Amazon.com and other retailers by the end of next week.

This book, along with my *Apache Cordova 3 Programming*, provide 600 pages of coverage for Apache Cordova. These two books give mobile developers everything they need to be able to write cross-platform mobile applications using Apache Cordova or Adobe PhoneGap.
