Apparently the folks at PhoneGap have decided to adopt the Microsoft Metro interface for the PhoneGap web site ([phonegap.com](https://phonegap.com){target="_blank"}). It's pretty cool what happens when you resize the browser window - whoever implemented this really paid attention to that particular detail. Cool stuff.
