I'm just putting the final touches on an article I wrote for the [View](https://www.eview.com).The article covers options for mobile development using Domino. The article ended up being so long, that they had to split it into two parts. Part 1 highlights web development options and part 2 covers native and mobile platform (MEAP) applications. Essentially this will be the second (and third) article in the series that covers everything related to mobilizing Lotus Domino data.

I'm also doing an evaluation of the Kryos Velocity platform for Domino (Velocity Designer for Lotus Domino) and am almost finished with a review of the product that will hopefully find its way into a future issue of the View.
