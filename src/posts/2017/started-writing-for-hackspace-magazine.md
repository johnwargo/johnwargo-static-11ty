A few months ago, the folks at the Raspberry Pi Foundation asked me to write a series of articles on Arduino development for a new magazine they're creating. The magazine is called [HackSpace Magazine,](https://hsmag.cc){target="_blank"} and the first issue is available (free) now.

My first article starts on page 82; its an introduction to coding for the Arduino platform.
