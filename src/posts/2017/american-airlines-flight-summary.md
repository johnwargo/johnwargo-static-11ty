American Airlines sent me an interesting infographic this week, it summarized all of my flight activity for the year. It was interesting to see that with all of my flights, I flew enough to circle the globe twice this year. Surprising, until I remembered that I flew to Israel and Slovakia this year. No surprise that Seattle was my primary destination considering I now work for Microsoft. Here's the infographic.
