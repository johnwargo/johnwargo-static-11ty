    "description": "I needed to drill a counter sink hole in a two inch wide slat for a love seat/bench. This jig held the slat perfectly in position on my drill press table as I drilled holes in 8 slats. There are even holes on the underside for 10mm x 5 mm rare earth magnets to hold it to the iron drill press top."
