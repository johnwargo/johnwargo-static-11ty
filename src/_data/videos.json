It was a very successful and award winning tool for automating the deployment of IBM Lotus Notes. After we won an IBM Beacon Award for Best Tool/Utility, IBM sent a film crew to our offices for a few days to film the video behind the link here."

    "description": "This is a link to a video recording of my Building Mobile Applications using Open Source Frameworks session from NCDevCon 2017. I thought Iâ€™d leverage my experience with Cordova and Ionic while at the same time using this opportunity to learn more about NativeScript and React Native. I bit off way, way more than I could cover in my short 50 minute session, but it was fun. I basically built the same application four ways, one for each target I listed above. You'll find the presentation file as an attachment to this article."

Conference presentations are delivered on two stages, the link here is for the main stage on conference day one. My session was late in the afternoon (at 2 or 3, I can't remember) and demonstrated how to use Visual Studio Mobile Center CodePush capabilities to deliver A/B testing for React Native applications. I also did a quick 4 minute (literally) lightning talk on how to use a new feature of Visual Studio Code to apply the TypeScript compiler to a JavaScript file."

In this 30 minute session, I talk a bit about mobile development approaches, then wrap up with where mobile development is going."
