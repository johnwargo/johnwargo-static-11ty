    "description": "Apps are king. Or, for some, god. Either way, they are the future of not only how we play, but how we work and therein lies opportunity. In order to take advantage of this, there are several strategic steps developers must take as they set out to create a beautiful app which then, in a perfect world, morphs into a business. First, obviously you need an idea - don't have one? We'll talk about the best lines of business and where you can have the most beneficial impact. Obviously on our minds is the enterprise - it is in dire need of savvy app developers. How can you explore that territory? We'll also cover technical issues like how to implement an API layer to facilitate the flow of data into or out of your application or solution; how to manage and deliver the data, how to find and connect to the enterprises systems, databases and other services that you need; and last but not least, how to bring your beautiful app to market, from testing to monetizing."

    "description": "Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are the bright future of desktop and mobile applications. There are different ways to look at PWAs, but in general they’re interactive web applications built using specific browser capabilities that enable the web apps to work and act more like native apps. Research firm Gartner was so confident in the growth of PWAs that they predicted that 50% of all consumer apps would be PWAs this year. Many of the web applications you currently use are most likely PWAs with Google releasing Gmail as a PWA and Microsoft delivering both Outlook and OneDrive as PWAs this year. In this fast-paced session chock full of technical details, you’ll learn how build your own progressive web applications. You’ll learn how to make your app installable using web app manifests and some JavaScript code. You’ll also learn how to make your web app work in offline mode on compatible browsers using service workers. You’ll also learn about all the ways service workers can enhance the capabilities of a web application."
