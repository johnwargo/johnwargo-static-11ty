<p>I attended a variety of conferences and events over the years, and sometimes I get a chance to present at them. Often I'm there working a booth or doing product demos somewhere, it just depends on the event. The following is a list of some events I attended. I'll add more as new ones pop up.</p>

{% include 'pagination-count.html' %}

<ul class="posts">
  {% for item in items %}
    <li>
      <h4>
        {{ item.title }}
      </h4>
      <span class="date">
        <strong>Date:
        </strong>
        {{ item.date }}
        {% if item.url.length > 0 %}
          |
          <a href="{{ item.url }}" target="_blank">
            <strong>Link to Event</strong>
          </a>
        {% endif %}
      </span>
      {% if item.description %}
        {{ item.description }}
      {% endif %}
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
