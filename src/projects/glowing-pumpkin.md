description: All about my different Glowing Pumpkin projects.

My children (twins) were born around Halloween, so that's always been a big holiday for us. Many years ago, I think when I found NeoPixels, I started building projects that used technology to enhance Halloween decorations. One of my favorites, and the one I wrote about here multiple times, is my Glowing Pumpkin project. Since there's so many posts and GitHub repos about these projects, I created this page to list everything in one place.

So, with that in mind, here's a table that summarizes all of my posts and GitHub Repos (with Gists if I remember) related to the NeoPixel-driven Glowing Pumpkins I created over the years.
