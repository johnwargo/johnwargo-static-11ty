    </h3>
    <p>
      Many, many years ago I was sitting around one night and wondered if anyone ever registered the Acme Dynamite
      domain. A quick check proved that it was available, so I registered it. I haven't done anything with the site, but
      I'm pretty sure I'll eventually setup john@acmedynamite.com as one of my personal email addresses.

    </h3>
    <p>
      Another really old site for me. When I was knee deep in mobile development I realized we were approaching a world
      without apps, where voice interaction would replace applications. It turns out I was right, especially with all of
      the AI stuff that's happening now, but it's been quite a while since I've posted anything to the site.

    </h3>
    <p>
      My daughter is an accomplished Cosplayer and she's taken over my workshop with her cosplay projects. One day I
      went looking for a domain I could use to publish a site where I publish articles about the the tools and stuff I
      provide her to help her with her projects. I quickly found this domain and built my first Eleventy site there.

    </h3>
    <p>
      I have several mobile apps in the Android and Apple App Stores and I was looking for an interesting name for my
      app software company. Reading a very old Poul Anderson novel (from the 1950's) I came across the term 'fumbly
      diddling around' and the name for my software company was born.
