    <p>
      This utility converts a downloaded public certificate file (a .pem or .crt file) into a header file you can use with an Espressif device (ESP-32, for example) in the Arduino IDE with the Arduino WiFiClientSecure library to make secure connections (HTTPS) to remote servers. Without access to the certificate, an Arduino sketch cannot connect to the remote server over a secure connection.

    <p>
      Goodreads is an excellent web application for tracking book reading activity. However, its page count is often inaccurate (flat out wrong from including notes, appendices, and other stuff in the page count). To get Goodreads to display an accurate completion percentage, you must adjust your current page read to accommodate; this application does it for you.

      The Path Backup & Restore application allows you to quickly backup your Windows system's Path settings to a local file then restore the Path using the backup file later. This is a free download for anyone to use.

    <p>
      I have several mobile apps in the Android and Apple App Stores and I was looking for an interesting name for my
      app software company. Reading a very old Poul Anderson novel (from the 1950's) I came across the term 'fumbly
      diddling around' and the name for my software company was born.
