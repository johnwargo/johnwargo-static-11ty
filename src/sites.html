    </h3>
    <p>
      Many, many years ago I was sitting around one night and wondered if anyone ever registered the Acme Dynamite
      domain. A quick check proved that it was available, so I registered it. I haven't done anything with the site, but
      I'm pretty sure I'll eventually setup john@acmedynamite.com as one of my personal email addresses.

    </h3>
    <p>
      Another really old site for me. When I was knee deep in mobile development I realized we were approaching a world
      without apps, where voice interaction would replace applications. It turns out I was right, especially with all of
      the AI stuff that's happening now, but it's been quite a while since I've posted anything to the site.

    </h3>
    <p>
      My daughter is an accomplished Cosplayer and she's taken over my workshop with her cosplay projects. One day I
      went looking for a domain I could use to publish a site where I publish articles about the the tools and stuff I
      provide her to help her with her projects. I quickly found this domain and built my first Eleventy site there.

    </h3>
    <p>
      I have several mobile apps in the Android and Apple App Stores and I was looking for an interesting name for my
      app software company. Reading a very old Poul Anderson novel (from the 1950's) I came across the term 'fumbly
      diddling around' and the name for my software company was born.

    <p> During the pandemic, I started work on some hardware projects that resulted in several products I plan on kickstarting in fall of 2023. I named the company as a variant of the Fumbly Diddle company name, this particular organization is a registered LLC in North Carolina.

    <p>  About the time I finished my 4th book or so, I decided to create a web site that lists all of my books, magazine articles, and other published content. Eventually, I'll migrate all of this site's content into this property.

    </h3>
    <p>Over the last 30 years or so I've written a lot of code. As soon as I had a solid catalog of projects published to [GitHub](https://github.com/johnwargo), I created this site to give me a place to publish descriptions of the different projects and group them together in an organized way.

    <p>Back in the 1980's, when I was in college, I started a software company called McNelly SoftWorks and copyrighted all of my code under that company name. Starting in the 2000's I published several commercial software products under that name and eventually registered the company as an Ohio LLC. I even published my first book there as well.

    <p>Over the years I regularly encounter errors in my development work that takes me a long time to sort out.  I started this site to document those errors and the solutions I found for them.

    <p>This is the landing page for my first mobile app: Time Slicer. Its essentially a stop watch with categories, it lets you time allocated across different categories. I created the app for a variety of use cases such as tracking the time allocated to different topics in a new program, or tracking time spent on different tasks in a usability study.

    <p>The Internet home of my 2024 US Presidential campaign. Yes, I'm running for President; I did in 2020 as well, but suspended my campaign late in the election cycle to not interfere too much with the election considering how tight it was. I didn't want to be a distraction.
