My employer uses Google Apps (which includes Google Calendar and Gmail) and the appointment notification capabilities of both are not very robust. Well, theyâ€™re robust, but not enough to get me to actually show up for calls on time. What I find is that I often miss the notification when Iâ€™m busy doing something else or I notice the notification, but quickly forget about it just a few minutes later and ultimately miss some meetings or join late.<\/p>\r\n<p>One day, after being 15 minutes late for a meeting, I decided I had to fix this problem. I needed a more effective way to alert myself of upcoming appointments. As I spend a lot of time on the phone, I didnâ€™t want an audible alert, so I decided Iâ€™d do something visual. While browsing the Adafruit web site, I noticed the Pimoroni Unicorn HAT and that had me thinking of solution. The Unicorn HAT is an add-on board for the Raspberry Pi that consists of an 8Ã—8 array (thatâ€™s 64 total if youâ€™re counting) of bright RGB LEDs. What if I wrote a Raspberry Pi application that connected to Google Calendar and checked my calendar for my next appointment then flashed those 64 LEDs to let me know? As long as I was conscious, and in the room, Iâ€™d likely see them and decrease my chances of missing an appointment.<\/p>\r\n<p>Well, thatâ€™s what I did and Iâ€™ll show you how to do it too.<\/p>","hits":"3080","state":"1","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","ordering":"45","access":"1","params":"{\"target\":\"\",\"width\":\"\",\"height\":\"\",\"count_clicks\":\"\"}","language":"*","created":"2016-06-15 18:50:27","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2019-04-29 12:02:10","modified_by":"62","metakey":"","metadesc":"","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\"}","featured":"0","xreference":"","publish_up":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","version":"4","images":"{\"image_first\":\"\",\"float_first\":\"\",\"image_first_alt\":\"\",\"image_first_caption\":\"\",\"image_second\":\"\",\"float_second\":\"\",\"image_second_alt\":\"\",\"image_second_caption\":\"\"}"},
