The resposnes were that no good books existed and that all you needed was access to the BlackBerry Developer's web site and the JavaDocs for the Java development tools. I happen to not agree. While RIM has a lot of great information on their web site, most of it was written from the standpoint that you kinda already know what you're doing. There is some development 101 stuff there, but there's no place to find everything there is to know about how to build BlackBerry applications.<\/p>\r\n<p>That's why I wrote the book.<\/p>\r\n<p>One of the forum members had posted a link to a <a href=\"http:\/\/supportforums.blackberry.com\/rim\/board\/message?board.id=java_dev&amp;thread.id=13264&amp;jump=true\" target=\"_blank\">list of (very useful) links<\/a> for a BlackBerry Developer, but they focused on Java Development. when I replied with information about my book, he responded with:<\/p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"border-style: none; margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; padding: 0px;\">\"IMHO this information is far more better than any existing book on bb development. Long time ago when I started with BB development I had only JDE samples at hands.

I have two issues with this:<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>There aren't any existing BlackBerry Development Books<\/li>\r\n<li>Everyone assumes that to start working with BlackBerry Development means beginning with Java<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>There is still a whole ton of ancillary information that must be understood before you can really understand BlackBerry Development. If you take a look at the book, (it's not published yet, so this number may be off) there is about 300 pages of detailed content before even beginning to talk about Java development and the BlackBerry Java Development Tools. The Java documentation doesn't explain:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>What the different paths a request can take to a server (WAP, BIS-B, Direct TCP, MDS, Wi-fi)<\/li>\r\n<li>What MDS is and what it does to provide secure access to internal resources and optimize data communication to the device<\/li>\r\n<li>What Application Data Push is and what all the available options are<\/li>\r\n<li>What some of the unique features of the BlackBerry Browser<\/li>\r\n<li>How to debug web applications<\/li>\r\n<li>How to use the different Java development tools<\/li>\r\n<li>How to deploy Java applications<\/li>\r\n<li>How to use the MDS Simulator and the BlackBerry device simulators<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>and a whole bunch more.

{"id":"15","asset_id":"58","title":"What is it with Ruby books?","alias":"what-is-it-with-ruby-books","introtext":"<p>I work for a company (BoxTone) that has a web-based enterprise software product using Rails. Being a product manager, I wanted to know more about the technologies being used to create the product I'm responsible for managing - makes sense, right?  So I set out looking for a book to read on Ruby then later I'll dig into Rails.  Being a huge fan of O'Reilly books (even though they passed on my BlackBerry book) I purchased a copy of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1593271484?ie=UTF8&tag=mcnsof-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1593271484\" target=\"_blank\">Ruby by Example: Concepts and Code<\/a><img src=\"http:\/\/www.assoc-amazon.com\/e\/ir?t=mcnsof-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1593271484\" border=\"0\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" \/> and started reading it.<\/p><p>Hated it. <\/p><p>I've been a professional software developer for more than 20 years now and I thought I could leverage that experience and just pick up rails by example. The book's examples were so obtuse and the descriptions of the code so incomplete that I spent a lot of time scratching my head, trying to figure out what the sample code was actually doing. Not a good thing for a 'by example' book.<\/p><p>So, I set that book aside and started reading <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B0028N4W6A?ie=UTF8&tag=mcnsof-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0028N4W6A\" target=\"_blank\">Learning Ruby<\/a><img src=\"http:\/\/www.assoc-amazon.com\/e\/ir?t=mcnsof-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0028N4W6A\" border=\"0\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" \/> (also from O'Reilly). It's a better book in that it's fast hitting, short code samples and a direct explanation of every topic as it's presented. My problem with the book is that the many of the code examples actually make it harder to understand the topic being discussed.  When discussing Regular Expressions, the book gives repeated examples <strong>that all have the same result<\/strong>! It's crazy. When learning RegEx, I don't want to see example after example of a RegEx applied to a two line string return the first line of the string over and over and over again. What I want to see is a big string and how I can use RegExes to pull out part of it in several ways.  It just makes it harder to learn when you see the same result of an expression repeatedly.<\/p><p>Anyway, after reading hundreds of computer books in my life, why are Ruby books so poor?  <\/p><p>The final straws for me were twofold. <\/p><p>An example of how to use  the .reverse method to reverse the order of characters in a string. One of the examples the author gave was to use this method to <strong>reverse the order of a palindrome<\/strong>! How is that a good example of how to use a method? \"OK, I'm going to show you how to reverse the order of characters of a string comprised of characters that spell the same thing forward and backwards.\" Huh? How do you even tell the difference between before and after? What's the point? Wow!<\/p><p>Later on, there is a discussion of using .ljust and .rjust to left and right justify strings. Right in the middle of the discussion, the author says:<\/p><p align=\"center\">\"Still confused? So am I, but we'll go on\"<\/p><p>Huh?  Seriously? Is that how the author feels about me? \"ya, I know you're confused, so am I, let's ignore it and move on.\" Uh, that doesn't help me learn how things work. It's weird that he spends so much time discussing something that's pretty easy to understand anyway then tells us he's confused? No, not what I expect.<\/p><p>Ruby is a little different and it's a cool language, but I just don't understand why the two leading books on the topic I picked up by a very respectable publisher are so bad.  Please don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to bash O'Reilly, I have almost 40 of their books in my library, it must just be ruby authors ;-). <\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2009-07-10 09:39:41","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2009-07-10 09:39:41","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"9","ordering":"144","metakey":"Ruby Book, Ruby Books","metadesc":"A discussion of my dissatisfaction with Ruby Books.","access":"1","hits":"7929","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

After a few minutes of holding the phone, he got tired of holding it and placed the phone (with the speakerphone turned on) on the empty pizza box.

These tools had been in beta for a whlie and I got a chance to work with them while writing the book chapter around debugging web applications. The tools are a plug-in for Eclipse and another for Microsoft Visual Studio. They basically allow a web developer to build web applications (static or dynamic) and debug them on BlackBerry devices directly from within the IDE. The cool thing about them is that the debugger from either IDE connects to the device simulator through the debugger and allows developers to step through dynamic code (JavaScript, AJAX code using XMLHTTPRequest and more) while it runs in the simulator. If needed, it can also do the same thing directly through an USB-connection to a physical device. Way cool.<\/p>\r\n<p>The thing I liked the most was the window that could be used to watch all traffic between the device and web server using XMLHTTPRequest. If I was building an AJAX application (I refuse to treat it as a word, it's an acronym), I'd need this tool to make debugging and troubleshooting as simple as possible.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"2","created":"2009-07-28 15:16:48","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2009-07-28 15:16:48","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"3","ordering":"61","metakey":"BlackBerry Development, BlackBerry Tools for Web Developers, BlackBerry Eclipse, BlackBerry Visual Studio","metadesc":"RIM formally announced the new BlackBerry Tools for Web Developers.","access":"1","hits":"8802","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

I thought I was signing up for email alerts and wasn't paying attention when they asked for my phone number.  Turns out they're SMS alerts. What IT related news could be important enough that I would need to be sent an SMS alert?  Just send me an email. it just doesn't make sense.<\/p>\r\n<p>I went back in and tried repeatedly to find some way to cancel the alert but the company managing the site has links for subscribing to the service but absolutely nothing about how to unsubscribe. so, I waited patiently for the first alert thinking there might be a way to reply and unsubscribe. Nope, nothing. So after a couple of months of getting these SMS messages I really didn't care about I finally contacted the editors of the magazine for help (I didn't have any other recourse, there was nothing on their site that led me to believe I could get help from anyone else). The editor responded immediately, apologized for the trouble and promised to get it taken care of.  No change - I'm still getting alerts. Every time I do, I send an email to the editor and he promises to fix the problem (over and over again). Don't get me wrong, I don't think he's not trying to help me - I just think that the company they've outsourced this 'feature' to is clueless and just not being responsive.<\/p>\r\n<p>I hope someday they finally figure this out and remove me from their mailing list. The issue I have is that SMS messages cost my employer money and I can't have that.<\/p>\r\n<p>UPDATE: They appear to have finally removed me from the mailing list.

So when you say 'PIN Number' what you're actually saying is 'Personal Identification Number Number.'  It just doesn't make sense. Why be redundant?<\/p>\r\n<p>The next one of course is ATM Machine – we all know ATM stands for Automated Teller Machine but why then do people say 'ATM Machine?'  That’s like saying ‘Automated Teller Machine Machine.’ There’s even a McDonalds near me that has a sign hanging proudly in the driveway that says ‘ATM Machine Inside.’<\/p>\r\n<p>I used to design networks and it’s crazy when so many people say ‘NIC Card.’ NIC stands for Network Interface Card so when you say 'NIC Card' you’re saying ‘Network Interface Card Card’ – it’s redundant.<\/p>\r\n<p>I was in a car accident a while back, someone backed into me in a parking lot (I was too startled to use my horn, that would have saved me some aggravation – more on that one later). When I called the insurance company to make the claim, the claims representative said to me: ‘What is the VIN number for your car?’ I couldn’t resist, I asked her – ‘You have to know that VIN stands for Vehicle Identification Number, why would you say VIN Number (Vehicle Identification Number Number)?’ She laughed and said that that’s what people expect them to call it, so they ignore the fact that it’s redundant and say it anyway.<\/p>\r\n<p>I had a customer who for the longest time would (probably still does) say ‘DMZ Zone’ when referring to a network’s De-Militarized Zone. Of course I had to find a way to immediately use the term correctly to try to help him see how to use the acronym in a sentence but he never caught on: ‘Yes, the server would be placed in the DMZ here.’  Too funny! What I never figured out is what does he think the ‘Z’ stands for in DMZ? Does he even understand what DMZ actually stands for?  I’ll never know, I wouldn’t risk the customer relationship by embarrassing him; perhaps I’ll run into him some day and finally get around to asking him.<\/p>\r\n<p>Of course there’s the BlackBerry Enterprise Server (The BES) – what I can’t figure out is why do people feel the need to say ‘BES Server’?  That’s like saying ‘BlackBerry Enterprise Server Server.’ This one I know is a little nebulous since you may be trying to say something about the Server running BES and the phrase seems incomplete without the second ‘server’ like you’re leaving out a word. Some people even take it a step further and spell it out: ‘B. E. S.’ - it’s just a BES (pronounced like fez) nothing more. Now Research In Motion’s Education Services folks are supposedly not allowed to call it a BES. For them, BES stands for BlackBerry Enterprise Solution. This is even funnier – so, your BES (solution) consists of a server running the BES (server) software. ‘Yes, my BlackBerry Enterprise Solution implementation consists of a BlackBerry Enterprise Server running on this box…’<\/p>\r\n<p>OK, now finally back to the PIN.<\/p>\r\n<p>This is a mystery that continues to befuddle me. Each BlackBerry device has a unique PIN associated with it. If you follow convention, it’ makes sense that the PIN stands for ‘Personal Identification Number’ but that doesn’t make sense. Why would a smartphone need a personal number?  I could see a mobile user needing a PIN, but why does a piece of hardware need a PIN?  I asked around when I worked at Research In Motion and nobody could tell me what it really stood for. I asked as many long term employees as I could find and even searched and searched the company intranet for the information, but nowhere could I find what PIN stands for.<\/p>\r\n<p>As I started the book, I wanted to solve this mystery and write about it. I ended up not having the time to massage this topic into the book, so I decided to write about it here. <br \/>Wikipedia says the BlackBerry PIN is “an eight character hexadecimal unique identification number assigned to each BlackBerry device. PINs cannot be changed and are locked to each handset device. BlackBerry devices can message each other using the PIN directly or by using the Blackberry Messenger application.” You can find the reference and the rest of the text here: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Blackberry_PIN#BlackBerry_PIN\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Blackberry_PIN#BlackBerry_PIN<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>I finally looked around on Research In Motion’s web site and found my confirmation, it does stand for ‘Personal Identification Number.’ I still don’t know why a smartphone needs a personal identifier, but it doesn’t work as a ‘Phone Identification Number’ since the early BlackBerry devices (with PIN’s) weren’t phones, they were just wireless email devices. If you have more information, please use the ‘contact me’ link on the left to send me an email – I’ll be happy to update the site.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, to be consistent with the theme for this posting, when talking about the BlackBerry PIN, the last letter already stands for ‘number’, so don’t you <strong>ever<\/strong> let me ever catch you saying ‘PIN number’!<\/p>\r\n<p>After I posted this, my friend Dan reminded me: \"Let's not forget software program.  Off to the department of redundancy department with you!\"<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"2","created":"2009-08-18 00:51:30","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2009-08-18 00:51:30","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"3","ordering":"55","metakey":"BlackBerry PIN","metadesc":"My problem with PIN","access":"1","hits":"7864","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

{"id":"36","asset_id":"78","title":"BlackBerry Keyboard Shortcuts","alias":"blackberry-keyboard-shortcuts","introtext":"<p>You probably already know this, but I thought I’d write about it anyway just in case. So many times people pick up a new piece of technology and focus so much on the hard things that they miss some of the cool easy things. For smartphones, all of them have special shortcuts that make day to day use of them less painful – but so many users just don’t know about them.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">On the BlackBerry smartphone, most business people spend the majority of their time in the email client write, reading, filing, forwarding and responding. Since it takes up so much of your time, let’s make sure you’re as efficient as possible. I’m a keyboard guy, so that’s where a lot of this comes from. It’s not that I don’t like to use the trackball or a mouse, but when I’m on a computer or my BlackBerry, my hands (or my thumbs) are already hovering above the keyboard, so I just don’t feel the need to move over (or up) to grab the mouse or trackball when I can just use the keyboard.  Here we go…<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">When you open the BlackBerry ‘Messages’ application, the highlight is always on the current date. To create a new email message, merely press the enter key with the date selected and the BlackBerry will open a new message for you to start typing in. There’s no need to click the menu button and select ‘Compose Email.’<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><img class=\"caption\" src=\"images\/stories\/messages client.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"BlackBerry Message List\" title=\"BlackBerry Message List\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">To open an email message, there’s no need to click the trackball or use the menu to open a message, just select the message and press the ‘Enter’ key.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">When browsing messages in the Messages application, the following shortcuts are active:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>‘t’: Go to the top of the message list<\/li>\r\n<li>‘b’: Go to the bottom of the message list<\/li>\r\n<li>‘u’: Go to the first (oldest) unread message<\/li>\r\n<li>‘n’: Go to the next date in the list<\/li>\r\n<li>‘p’: Go to the previous date in the list<\/li>\r\n<li>‘space bar’: To page down through the list of messages one screen at a time.<\/li>\r\n<li>‘i’: to file the selected message in a folder<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>With a message highlighted in the message list, you can delete the message by pressing the ‘delete’ key on the keyboard. There’s no need to open the menu and select ‘Delete’ - that takes much longer.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">When reading a message, the same keys apply:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>‘t’: Go to the top of the message<\/li>\r\n<li>‘b’: Go to the bottom of the message<\/li>\r\n<li>‘u’: Go to the first (oldest) unread message in the message list<\/li>\r\n<li>‘n’: Go to the next date message in the message list<\/li>\r\n<li>‘p’: Go to the previous date in the message list<\/li>\r\n<li>‘space bar’: To page down through the message one screen at a time<\/li>\r\n<li>‘i’: to file the message in a folder<\/li>\r\n<li>‘delete’: Delete the current message<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>So, when you’ve gotten off of a plane or left a meeting and you want to get caught up on your email, there’s no need to open a message, close it and navigate to the next one. All you need to do is open the first message then press the ‘u’ button repeatedly until you’ve read all of the unread messages.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I remember reading a comparison between BlackBerry and Windows Mobile and the reviewer complained about how ‘hard’ it was to press the ‘alt’ key to type a period at the end of every sentence. When typing any text on a BlackBerry, you can always press the space bar twice in succession to enter a period. When you press the key combination, the BlackBerry replaces the two spaces with a period and a space.  Makes it a lot easier, eh?<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There are a lot more of them, you can find a good article (and a lot more shortcuts) at <a href=\"http:\/\/crackberry.com\/blackberry-101-beginners-guide-keyboard-shortcuts\">http:\/\/crackberry.com\/blackberry-101-beginners-guide-keyboard-shortcuts<\/a>.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"2","created":"2009-08-22 13:45:25","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2009-08-22 13:45:25","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"5","ordering":"54","metakey":"BlackBerry Shortcuts, BlackBerry Keyboard Shortcuts","metadesc":"Some cool BlackBerry keyboard shortcuts","access":"1","hits":"9546","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"37","asset_id":"79","title":"Notes Keyboard Shortcuts","alias":"notes-keyboard-shortcuts","introtext":"<p> <\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">AS a follow-up to my BlackBerry keyboard shortcuts, I thought I’d share some Notes client keyboard shortcuts that I have always found helpful. As mentioned previously, I’m a keyboard guy – my hands are already hovering over the keyboard, why would I leave the keyboard to grab a mouse when I can get it done with what’s at hand (sorry about the pun).<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These shortcuts have been around forever, but so many people just don’t seem to know about them.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the Notes client, when you want to open a document in a view, just press the ‘Enter’ key and Notes will open it. You probably knew that one, but so many people will double-click on it as if they don’t know there’s another way.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">When you have a document open and you want to delete it, just press the ‘delete’ key – there’s no need to return to the view to delete it. If there are documents in the view below the one you opened, Notes will mark the current document for deletion then open the next document in the view – nice, huh?<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If you’re reading a document in a view and you want to open the next document in the view, there’s no need to close the current document then navigate to the next one – just press the ‘Enter’ key and Notes will close the current document then open the next.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If you’re reading a document in a view and you want to open the previous document in the view, there’s no need to close the current document then navigate to the previous one – just press the ‘Backspace’ key and Notes will close the current document then open the previous.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Imagine you’re populating a database with a lot of new documents. You have a list of data in front of you and you have to add a separate document for every row in a spreadsheet. Perhaps it’s a list of postal codes, product numbers or even office locations. There’s a keyboard shortcut that will simplify the whole process and allow you to add those documents in no time.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">What you need to do is open the view and create the first document. While the new document is open for editing in Notes, press the three key Ctrl-Shift-Enter  combination (I always find it easy to press and hold the Ctrl key, then do the same with the Shift key and finally press the Enter key then release). Notes will save the current document, close it then create a new blank document using the same form used for the previous document (the one you saved using this keyboard shortcut).<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nice, right? This is my favorite Notes keyboard shortcut of all time. It’s been in the client since Notes 2 and almost nobody knows about it. Try it out and let me know how much time you think this will save you the next time you need to populate a database by hand.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"3","created":"2009-08-22 13:47:45","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2009-08-26 05:00:00","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"3","ordering":"30","metakey":"Lotus Notes Keyboard Shortcuts","metadesc":"Some cool Notes keyboard shortcuts","access":"1","hits":"9042","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"38","asset_id":"80","title":"US Carriers Attitude Toward VOIP","alias":"carrier-voip","introtext":"<p>I'm continuously amazed at US Carriers attitude toward its customers. It's clear that everyday users just want to pay the carrier to use their network and be able to do whatever they want on it. The carriers of course don't want that - they want you to see them as providing specific servcies that you just can't do without and be willing to pay extra money for them. They're spending all of this money to add all these features when the majority of thier users just want email, SMS, phone and web browsing. I don't know about you, but I don't use any additional featurs provided by my carrier; I use the phone and my BlackBarry plan, nothing more.<\/p>\r\n<p>I was reading an interesting article on FirrceWireless this morning about how all of a sudden Apple is 'still evaluating' the Google Voice application they blocked. What prompted this post was the following statement:<\/p>\r\n<p>'In its response, AT&amp;T said it had nothing to do with the situation.<\/p>\r\n<p>Apple's lengthy statement included a number of interesting tidbits. The company said \"There is a provision in Apple's agreement with AT&amp;T that obligates Apple not to include functionality in any Apple phone that enables a customer to use AT&amp;T's cellular network service to originate or terminate a VoIP session without obtaining AT&amp;T's permission.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>In letters sent earlier this month to Apple and Google as well as iPhone operator partner AT&amp;T, the FCC asked why Apple chose to turn down Google Voice.'<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fiercewireless.com\/story\/apple-fcc-were-still-evaluating-google-voice-app\/2009-08-21?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=rss&amp;cmp-id=OTC-RSS-FW0#ixzz0P6OpuQLM\">http:\/\/www.fiercewireless.com\/story\/apple-fcc-were-still-evaluating-google-voice-app\/2009-08-21?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=rss&amp;cmp-id=OTC-RSS-FW0#ixzz0P6OpuQLM<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>The carriers are so afraid of VOIP since it allows customers to just use their network - even for voice calls. All of that revenue from phone minutes that are never used would go away if I could do VOIP over my BlackBerry data plan.<\/p>\r\n<p>What most people don't realize is that for most of these so called VOIP solutions for BlackBerry the phone call is still made over the Voice network. It's not a VOIP call. When you place a call on Skype for BlackBerry and likely Google Voice, the application connects to a data center somewhere and tells it the user wants to make a call. The back-end application dials the BlackBerry device and, when the BlackBerry application accepts the call, dials the desitination phone number and connects it to the BlackBerry. There's no VOIP here - the app is using the data network to initiate the call, but the actual call is executed on the carrier's voice network.<\/p>\r\n<p>The other mind boggling aspect of this is UMA - a technology used by T-Mobile in the US to allow you to use a Wi-Fi network connection to place voice calls. Yep, it's VOIP, but get this - you have to pay the carrier to use it.  So, if you own a company and you have a Wi-Fi network, you can place calls over your own internal network, but your wireless carrier is going to charge you a monthly fee to use the feature. Huh? You're going to charge me to use my own network and equipment to place phone calls?  That's CRAZY!<\/p>\r\n<p>The carriers are going to have to wake up and realize what their customers really want and stop blocking these technologies. If not, there's going to be a revolution. Some carrier is going to come around that's going to understand that they're just a pipe and make it easy for their customers. I'd gladly pay $100 a month to be able to do anything I wanted on the network - provided they stopped putting all sorts of junk applications on my devcie and stopped trying to get me to buy all sorts of extra services.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2009-08-24 11:21:12","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2009-08-24 11:21:12","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"2","ordering":"137","metakey":"BlackBerry, VOIP, US Carrier","metadesc":"Discussion of US Carrier attitude toward VOIP","access":"1","hits":"8548","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

I've been maintaining a long list of topics I want to write about here and it was filling up my task on my BlackBerry and desktop mail client. All of a sudden I had more personal tasks than work tasks and that's not good. I could maintain them in a word doc but then having access to the list from multiple places would be problematic. I use <a href=\"http:\/\/centered.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Second Copy<\/a> to synchronize personal files between my laptop and desktop (which I'll write about in a few weeks), but I don't have many and it wasn't worth the effort to setup a new profile for just this one file.<\/p>\r\n<p>I thought I'd give Docs a try to see how it would work for me and I found it to be a really good fit. I quickly logged in and created a list of all of my topics. The editor has all of the features I need and I can work locally then save the document in the cloud when I'm on the network. I can then access (and update) the file from my personal desktop at home and my laptop while I'm on the road.  I lose the ability to have the list on my BlackBerry (I haven't accessed Docs from my device yet, I'm assuming it won't work - no Gears client until Device Software 5.0) but that's not important to me since the only time I use the BlackBerry for this is to quickly add a new item to the list which only seems to happen on airplanes. I'll just add the topic to my tasks list then copy it over to the document when I can. No biggie.<\/p>\r\n<p>I am seeing one interesting and annoying issue with the tool. I'm an expert Word user (sorry to brag) and use Headings to organize the structure of my documents and when you create a heading then enter a carriage return to begin the next line - for some bizarre reason Docs treats the heading and the first word that follows as the same word - and underlines it as a spelling error.<\/p>\r\n<p>Printing is an interesting experience - when you print, Docs makes a PDF of the file on the fly and sends it to the browser. The browser opens Adobe Acrobat and lets you print, email, even mark-up the document. Pretty cool and a smooth feature.<\/p>\r\n<p>My wife is going to help a friend create a resume tonight. I suggested Docs for this since my wife could help her create it then it would be accessible to both my wife and her friend. They can both work on it without needing to be in the same location. If it needs tweaking, my wife can make the updates and her friend could read it, email it or print it no matter where she is.<\/p>\r\n<p>All in all, a good tool for me.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2009-09-03 00:53:14","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2009-09-03 00:53:14","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"4","ordering":"135","metakey":"Google Docs","metadesc":"An article documenting my experiences with Google Docs.","access":"1","hits":"8327","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

{"id":"45","asset_id":"86","title":"Domino & BlackBerry Java Applications - Part 1","alias":"dbja1","introtext":"<h1>Introduction<\/h1>\r\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong> removed obsolete attachments November 11, 2022<\/p>\r\n<p>When I worked at Research In Motion and after, I’ve presented at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lotusphere.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lotusphere<\/a> and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lotusdeveloper2010.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">View Domino Developer Conference<\/a> on how to access Domino applications from BlackBerry devices.<\/p>\r\n<p>Of course, the lead approach was to use the browser to access mobile friendly Domino applications. It’s not a very exciting demo though – you take a domino database and scrunch it down so it fits the smaller screen and uses rich media sparingly.<\/p>\r\n<p>The other option I discussed was to create Web Services in a Domino application then use Research In Motion’s MDS Runtime technology to access the operations exposed by these services. It was a truly amazing demonstration to illustrate the web service then build a rich (non-browser) BlackBerry application that talked to it in minutes. With Research In Motion’s recent announcement of the end of life of MDS Runtime and associated development tools – developers need another option for building a (non-browser) rich client application that talks to web services. I’m sure there’s a way to do it from a BlackBerry Widget but I still haven’t had a chance to play with that technology yet.&nbsp; The only other option is to consume the Web Service from a Java application and for my presentation this year at the View Domino Developer conference I built a Java version of the application I’d been demonstration for years using MDS Runtime.<\/p>\r\n<p>A few weeks ago I posted here that I was going to write some articles about how to build that application. From the responses I received, it seems that there are a lot of you who are interested in the information, so here we go…<\/p>\r\n<p>I’m going to split this topic into three parts:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Part 1: (this article) How to build the Domino Web Service used in the sample application<\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=47:dbja2&amp;catid=2&amp;Itemid=4\">Part 2: How to create the Web Service Stub called by the Java application<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=67:bbdja3&amp;catid=2&amp;Itemid=4\">Part 3: How to build the Java application (for BlackBerry of course) that talks to the service<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>Before we begin, it’s important to highlight that Research In Motion has published a lot of information about connecting to a Domino application from a BlackBerry device – be sure to check out <a href=\"http:\/\/na.blackberry.com\/eng\/developers\/started\/develop\/ibm.jsp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">na.blackberry.com\/eng\/developers\/started\/develop\/ibm.jsp<\/a> for additional information on the topic.<\/p>\r\n<h1>Learning How to Build a Domino Web Service<\/h1>\r\n<p>When I first set about learning about how to build Web Services in Domino, there really wasn’t much information available. The first I’d heard about it was from some old articles that Gary Devendorf (now at Microsoft, go figure) on how to do web services in ND6 (that’s Notes &amp; Domino 6 for the uninitiated). It was quite a mess; you had to build an agent that could read and write XML and had to hand craft the service’s WSDL to use with some tools.<\/p>\r\n<p>With the release of Domino 7, IBM made it much easier to build web services. Ultimately, the way I learned how to create the sample application in this article was from reading this: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/lotus\/library\/nd7-webservices\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/lotus\/library\/nd7-webservices\/<\/a>. If you don’t know how to do web services in Domino, that’s a great place to start reading.<\/p>\r\n<h1>About the Project<\/h1>\r\n<p>When I first started looking for a good sample application for Domino developers I looked for something that would appeal to the widest audience of developer. I thought about how every Domino environment I’d ever worked with had at least one (sometimes more) additional contact databases outside of the standard Domino Directory. Since the BlackBerry already provided search capabilities against the Domino Directory, it seemed like a good idea to build a web service that would allow BlackBerry applications to lookup contacts in one of these other databases.<\/p>\r\n<p>Assuming that most of these additional contact databases were created against a copy of the Domino Directory, I built the web service using that template as a starting point. If you use this web service against a database that wasn’t built off of that template, you will have to change the view, column and field names to match the needs of the target database.<\/p>\r\n<h1>Building the Web Service<\/h1>\r\n<p>The web service is used to lookup contact information for a particular person in the database. It contains two operations: GetUserList and GetUserDetails. GetUserList takes as a parameter a portion of the last name being searched for and returns an array containing the names of all contacts who’s last name begins with the specified string. GetUserDetails takes as a parameter the name of a contact and returns a UserInfo object containing several fields from the selected Contact document in the database.<\/p>\r\n<p>Let’s get started building the web service. To do this, you will need to use Domino Designer 7 or higher – the screen shots in this article were taken in Domino Designer 8.5. The database you’re creating will need to reside on a Domino server with the HTTP task enabled in order to be able to be accessed by the BlackBerry Java application we’ll create in Part 3.<\/p>\r\n<p>Open Domino Designer and open the contact database in design mode (it would be best to do this in a template, but that’s up to you). In designer, expand the ‘Code’ section of the design element hierarchy as shown in Figure 1. Right-click on ‘Web Services Providers’ and select ‘New Web Service Provider…’ as shown in the figure.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/dbja1-1.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><br \/>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>Designer will create a new Web Service and prompt for the properties for the service. In the first tab of the Web Service properties (shown in Figure 2) you will need to provide a name for your service. In this case, I am calling it ‘DomDirLookup’ – the class name for the Web Service must match the name you enter here.&nbsp; In this example, I named the service and the Port Type Class the same.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/dbja1-2.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><br \/>Figure 2<\/p>\r\n<p>On the security tab (shown in Figure 3) you will want to set the appropriate security properties for the Web Service. Depending on how confidential the data is in the database, you may want to force users to authenticate to the database before being granted access or you can just set the ACL default access to Reader to allow anyone in. If you need to be able to track access to the database, you will want to enable the ‘Run as web user’ checkbox so when the agent runs, it runs under the credentials of the person accessing the database.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/dbja1-3.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><br \/>Figure 3<\/p>\r\n<p>In the propeller head tab on the Web Services properties (shown in Figure 4) are settings that effect your ability to access the Web Service from a Java application. As shown in Figure 3, the Web Service’s ‘Programming Model’ must be set to ‘RPC’ and the ‘SOAP message format’ must be set to ‘Doc\/Literal.’ I found that without these settings, the Sun Java Wireless Toolkit was not able to create the necessary stub program needed to access the service from a Java application.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/dbja1-4.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><br \/>Figure 4<\/p>\r\n<p>Once you have all of the properties set, you must now start writing the code for the service. For this particular Web Service, I wrote all of the code in LotusScript. Because of the way I write agents and because of the way I loop through result sets in the agent, I added the following code to the ‘Options’ section of the Web Service.<\/p>\r\n<p>{codecitation class=\"brush:vb; gutter:false\"}Option Public<br \/>Option Declare<br \/>Option Base 1{\/codecitation}<\/p>\r\n<p>The rest of the code goes into the ‘Declarations’ section of the Service. Since we’re not running this code like an agent, the ‘Initialize’ and ‘Terminate’ sections of the Web Service aren’t used – everything is in the ‘Declarations.’ I could have broken some of the code out into subroutines, but that wasn’t needed for this simple service.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/dbja1-5.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 5<\/p>\r\n<p>At this point, let’s take a look at the core portion of the code:<\/p>\r\n<p>The first thing the code does is declare objects for the NotesDatabase and NotesSession objects.:<\/p>\r\n<p>{codecitation class=\"brush:vb; gutter:false\"}'Some Notes objects we'll need<br \/>Dim db As NotesDatabase<br \/>Dim s As NotesSession{\/codecitation}<\/p>\r\n<p>In the code that follows, the Web Service defines the UserList class which will return an array of Strings containing the list of contacts that matched the search criteria:<\/p>\r\n<p>{codecitation class=\"brush:vb; gutter:false\"}'The following class defines an array of strings<br \/>'that will be returned by the function GetUserList<br \/>Class UserList<br \/> Public users() As String&nbsp; <br \/>End Class{\/codecitation}<\/p>\r\n<p>Domino can’t return an array of string to the Web Service consumer, so I had to wrap the array into a class and return the class – the calling program will automatically convert the class to the appropriate array.<\/p>\r\n<p>Next I define a UserInfo class that contains the different values returned from the selected contact record (person document). In this case it’s just a bunch of fields I thought would be cool to use in the program – you may find that you need different fields returned for your particular application:<\/p>\r\n<p>{codecitation class=\"brush:vb; gutter:false\"}'the following class defines the user details <br \/>'that we will be returning for a detailed lookup<br \/>Class UserInfo<br \/> Public FirstName As String<br \/> Public LastName As String<br \/> Public FullName As String<br \/> Public EmailAddress As String<br \/> Public OfficePhone As String<br \/> Public MobilePhone As String<br \/>End Class{\/codecitation}<\/p>\r\n<p>Ok, that’s it for the setup – now we need to actually write the code that does all of the work.&nbsp; The first thing you must do is create the class defined when you gave the Web Service a name in Figure 2.&nbsp; After that comes one subroutine and two functions:<\/p>\r\n<p>{codecitation class=\"brush:vb; gutter:false\"}Class DomDirLookup<br \/><br \/> Sub New<br \/> 'Initialize our Notes session object<br \/> Set s = New NotesSession<br \/> 'Then get a handle to the current database<br \/> Set db = s.CurrentDatabase&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br \/> End Sub<br \/><br \/> Function GetUserList(searchStr As String) As UserList<br \/><br \/> End Function<br \/><br \/> Function GetUserDetails(searchStr As String) As UserInfo<br \/><br \/> End Function<br \/><br \/>End Class{\/codecitation}<br \/>The ‘New’ subroutine does some simple setup for the Web Service – gives it access to the current Session and the current database. This is code any experienced Domino developer has written hundreds of times, although not normally in a ‘New’ subroutine but rather in ‘Initialize.’<\/p>\r\n<p>The ‘GetUserList’ function is setup for the input parameter and returns the UserList class when it’s all finished. The ‘GetUserDetails’ works the same way, although it returns a UserInfo class as shown in the sample.<\/p>\r\n<p>Once the framework for the service has all been defined, all you have to do is plunk in the rest of the code needed to implement the functionality required for the GetUserList and GetUserDetail functions. Now, before you take a look at the completed code – please try to remember that I wrote this code to demonstrate how to consume a Domino Web Service from a BlackBerry device. I did not make any effort to make the code as clean and efficient as possible, I just wrote the code to have something to call – realizing that the BlackBerry stuff was cooler. If you look at the code and think there’s a better way to do it, then you’re probably right – please don’t tell me about it. ;-)<\/p>\r\n<p>All right, that being said – here’s the complete code for the Web Service. I tried to put in a bunch of comments so it will be easy to understand what I’m doing here. I’ll attach a Notes database with the full source code for the service to this article when I publish it.<\/p>\r\n<p>{codecitation class=\"brush:vb; gutter:false\"}'Notes Objects<br \/>Dim db As NotesDatabase<br \/>Dim s As NotesSession<br \/>Dim userView As NotesView<br \/>Dim userDoc As NotesDocument<br \/><br \/>'Other objects<br \/>Dim i As Integer<br \/><br \/>Const errorStr = \"ERROR\"<br \/><br \/>'The following class defines an array of strings<br \/>'that will be returned by the function GetUserList<br \/>Class UserList<br \/> Public users() As String&nbsp;

{"id":"47","asset_id":"87","title":"Domino & BlackBerry Java Applications - Part 2","alias":"dbja2","introtext":"<h1>Introduction<\/h1>\r\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong> removed obsolete attachments November 11, 2022<\/p>\r\n<p>In the <a href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=45:dbja1&amp;catid=3&amp;Itemid=5\">previous installment <\/a>in this series, I showed how to build a simple Domino Web Service that performed a lookup against a contact database built from the standard public Domino Directory template (pubnames.ntf)<\/p>\r\n<h1>First a Little Background<\/h1>\r\n<p>I should probably explain that the BlackBerry Platform added support for JSR 172 with the release of BlackBerry Device Software 4.3. It’s JSR 172, the <a href=\"http:\/\/jcp.org\/en\/jsr\/detail?id=172\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">J2ME Web Services Specification<\/a>, which gives BlackBerry Java applications the ability to easily consume web services. You could do the work without using JSR 172, using something like <a href=\"http:\/\/ksoap2.sourceforge.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">kSOAP 2<\/a>, but then you:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Wouldn’t be using a standard<\/li>\r\n<li>Would be relying upon an ancillary library to do the work<\/li>\r\n<li>Would have a larger application to deploy since your application needs access to all those extra library classes<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>Anyway, if you ask about this topic on the BlackBerry forums, you’ll receive responses that say JSR 172 is junk and you should use kSOAP 2 and others (like me) who will tell you it’s pretty easy and you should just use the stuff baked into the BlackBerry platform. Use the stuff that’s baked into the BlackBerry platform – it’s going to be much easier for you all around.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, the way this JSR 172 stuff works is you download the <a href=\"http:\/\/java.sun.com\/products\/sjwtoolkit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sun Java Wireless Toolkit for CLDC<\/a> and use a little utility that comes with it to analyze your web service’s WSDL (web service description language) file and build a Java&nbsp; stub class your Java application can call to consume the web service. Building the stub takes just a few minutes and calling the stub from your Java application is very easy as well.<\/p>\r\n<h1>Getting Started<\/h1>\r\n<p>To get this process rolling, go to Sun’s web site and download the Sun Java Wireless Toolkit for CLDC – the link is provided in the previous paragraph. After you have downloaded the package, run its installation program to install it on your local hard drive. As someone complained on the forums last week, it’s a whole lot of stuff for that one little utility. Unfortunately that’s true – the toolkit has a whole bunch of tools and utilities in it, we’re only using a very small part of it. I don’t know of any other way to get this to work than to just install the whole thing and live with it. After you install it, you’ll find a folder for the toolkit off the root of your system’s hard drive as shown in the following figure.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/dbja2-1.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>Fortunately it also puts the shortcuts you need onto the Windows Start menu right where you expect them to be as shown in Figure 2. <br \/>&nbsp;<br \/><img src=\"images\/stories\/dbja2-2.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2<\/p>\r\n<h1>Generating the Java Stub<\/h1>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Now that you have the toolkit installed, it’s time to build the Java stub you need to consume the service. For this part of the process, you must make sure that the database containing the web service is on a Domino server and the ACL is set correctly. You will also need to make sure that the Programming Model and SOAP Message format are set correctly in your web service. Refer to Figure 4 in the first installment in this series for information on how the service should be configured.<br \/>To make sure your service is working, you should open the service’s WSDL in the browser using the following URL:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">{codecitation class=\"brush:text; gutter:false\"}http:\/\/server-name\/db-name.nsf\/domdirlookup?wsdl{\/codecitation}<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Be sure to use the correct server name, database file name and service name for your implementation of the service. For my test environment, the WSDL URL looks like this:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">{codecitation class=\"brush:text; gutter:false\"}http:\/\/jwargo1\/bb_names.nsf\/domdirlookup?wsdl{\/codecitation}<\/p>\r\n<p>When I paste this URL into the browser, I will see the following page (or something similar):<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/><img src=\"images\/stories\/dbja2-3.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 3<\/p>\r\n<p>Note that some browsers such as Google Chrome don’t know how to render WSDL files. When I opened the same URL in the Chrome browser, all I got was a blank page.<\/p>\r\n<p>Once you have a working WSDL URL, you’re ready to generate your stubs. In the Start menu folder for the Sun Java Wireless Toolkit (shown in Figure 2) select the ‘Utilities’ shortcut. Windows will open a screen similar to the one shown below:<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/><img src=\"images\/stories\/dbja2-4.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 4<\/p>\r\n<p>Scroll down and select the item labeled ‘Stub Generator’ and click the ‘Launch’ button. The stub generator program will open as shown below:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/dbja2-5.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 5<\/p>\r\n<p>In the dialog, paste the Domino WSDL file URL into the ‘WSDL Filename or URL’ field on the form. You DO NOT want to navigate to a folder where you have exported the WSDL from the database – an exported WSDL does not contain the destination information the stub program will need to locate the server and database file name containing the web service.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>For the ‘Output Path’, specify a folder location on your hard drive where you want the stub class files created. For ‘Output Package’ specify the package name you want to use for the stub class. In this case, I’m saving the output to c:\\dev\\java and the program will create the necessary subfolders to match the output package (com.johnwargo.domdirlookup). <br \/>&nbsp;<br \/><img src=\"images\/stories\/dbja2-6.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 6<\/p>\r\n<p>The program will gyrate for a few seconds and inform you that the process completed. When you open Windows Explorer and look at the output path, What you’ll find is a complete folder structure shown below: <br \/>&nbsp;<br \/><img src=\"images\/stories\/dbja2-7.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 7<\/p>\r\n<p>Notice that the stub files were created in c:\\dev\\java\\com\\johnwargo\\domdirlookup – the concatenation of the output folder and the output package name.<\/p>\r\n<p>What you have here are four class files that implement all of the technology you need to consume the web service described by the WSDL you passed to the Stub Generator. Let’s tear into the files…<br \/>The USERLIST.java file contains the code that implements the UserList class (it’s an array of string, remember?) that’s returned by the web service when you pass in a search string and call the GetUserList method. All the stub generator does here is create the string array and the appropriate setters and getters for the class. Here’s the code:<\/p>\r\n<p>{codecitation class=\"brush:java; gutter:false\"}\/\/ This class was generated by the JAXRPC SI, do not edit.<br \/>\/\/ Contents subject to change without notice.<br \/>\/\/ JSR-172 Reference Implementation wscompile 1.0, using: JAX-RPC Standard Implementation (1.1, build R59)<br \/><br \/>package com.johnwargo.domdirlookup;<br \/><br \/>public class USERLIST {<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; protected java.lang.String[] USERS;<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public USERLIST() {<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public USERLIST(java.lang.String[] USERS) {<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this.USERS = USERS;<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public java.lang.String[] getUSERS() {<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return USERS;<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public void setUSERS(java.lang.String[] USERS) {<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this.USERS = USERS;<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br \/>}{\/codecitation}<br \/>The USERINFO.java file does the same thing, but for the UserInfo class defined in the web service. In this case, it’s not as simple as a string array, it’s a class that contains string values for each of the fields of the contact record (it’s a person document, remember?) the web service returns when the GetUserInfo method is called and passed a contact name in the search string. It contains the class definition and the setters and getters for each of the fields we’re returning for the selected contact name.

It defines GetUserList and GetUserInfo – remember them? They’re the two functions defined in the Domino web service we’re calling.

So many developers have to guess which devices to target for their first applications - soon we'll know.

Many years ago, it was a battle of Notes & Mail (IBM Domino) vs. Mail Only (Microsoft Exchange). For some yet to be understood bizarre reason, IBM let it become a Mail vs. Mail battle. All the amazing ammunition Domino had as an application platform, gone. All the amazing cross platform and Low cost of ownership benefits of Domino - Ignored. IBM let the comparison between Notes and Outlook be how Domino would compete against Exchange. You probably don't agree with me, but I like Outlook better than Notes for PIM. I hate Outlook on Exchange, but I do like Outlook.\r\n\r\n2. For so many CIO's it's an easy choice - You have just finished negotiating an enterprise license agreement with Microsoft for Office, Exchange and Windows Licenses and your Domino Admins start pressing for the budget to do a Domino upgrade. He looks at the numbers and says why should I be paying for two messaging CALs when I already get them free from Microsoft? No worries that it takes at least two to three times the hardware and two to three times the admin staff to run Exchange over Domino - it doesn't matter. No worries that Exchange and Outlook are much more susceptible to viruses, it doesn't matter. It's either 'I love Outlook so we're moving to Exchange' or 'I'm not paying for two messaging CAL's, so we're migrating to Exchange.'   Yes, I know - you can use Outlook against Domino - CIO's don't care.\r\n\r\nSorry to seem so bitter, but I've watched this happen time and time again. It saddens me.

Author had to admit that one has to install additional 'stuff' (WTK, or SDK 3.0)  to be able to ...\r\n3. JSR(172) is not a standard (http:\/\/jcp.org\/en\/jsr\/overview), although it is used as a standard :)\r\n\r\nOn a positive spin, I agree\/admit that \r\n1. Usage of third-party approaches (ksoap2) increases (although slightly) size of a final app.\r\n2. Complexity of JSR 172 implementation and ksoap2 are almost equal.\r\n3. With generated stub classes one can use eclipse BB plug-in as a development tool, whereas to utilize (ksoap2) jar file JDE is the only choice.\r\nSo in the end, it is up to Developer to decide which road to take.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, big thanks to author for these articles.","fulltext":"","state":"-2","catid":"11","created":"2009-09-16 11:36:25","created_by":"63","created_by_alias":"Nick","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2023-03-17 18:01:28","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"2","ordering":"1","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"1128","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

{"id":"63","asset_id":"101","title":"Domino & BlackBerry Java Applications Part 2.5","alias":"bbdja25","introtext":"<p><br \/>I’ve been getting a lot of questions and comments about the article series (which is great, keep them coming). I got some questions from Brendan yesterday and it was clear that I really didn’t cover a very important part of the stub generation process. It’s not that I missed it; it’s just that I was primarily trying to demonstrate something and didn’t cover all of the background information you would need to use this process with your web services.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>In the example I’ve provided with this article series (<a href=\"index.php\/Domino\/dbja1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Part 1<\/a> and <a href=\"index.php\/BlackBerry\/dbja2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Part 2<\/a>), I’ve deliberately selected a base web service that’s simple enough to be easily consumed using the capabilities provided by JSR 172. Since the specification (yep, it’s not a ‘standard’ as was pointed out last week) was designed for mobile devices, its designers deliberately selected a limited number of data types it would support thinking that it would reduce the potential load on devices and cover a majority of implementations.<\/p>\r\n<p>When I created the service, I created it with the knowledge that the Sun tools for creating the stub program only supported certain data types and I made sure I used them. The problem arises for those of you who want to build BlackBerry applications that consume web services that were not built with mobile users in mind. Let’s dig into the detail...<\/p>\r\n","fulltext":"\r\n<p>The specification for JSR 172 can be found here: <a href=\"http:\/\/jcp.org\/aboutJava\/communityprocess\/final\/jsr172\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JSR-00172 J2ME Web Services Specification<\/a>. If you read through the final specification (on page 26) you will see that the spec only supports the following data types:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>boolean<\/li>\r\n<li>byte<\/li>\r\n<li>short<\/li>\r\n<li>int<\/li>\r\n<li>long<\/li>\r\n<li>float<\/li>\r\n<li>double<\/li>\r\n<li>String<\/li>\r\n<li>complex types<\/li>\r\n<li>arrays of primitive and complex types<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>That’s it, nothing more. Now, you can build more complex data types using the primitives listed there, but if your application uses custom data types that the stub generator doesn’t recognize, it just won’t work. This I think is the root of Brendan’s problems. Here’s a snip from the document that shows the supported data types.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/jsr172 types.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><br \/><br \/>So, if you’re presented with a web service that you want to consume and it uses data types that aren’t supported, what do you <br \/>do?&nbsp; Well, you can:<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Ask the developer of the service to rewrite it using JSR 172-friendly data types<\/li>\r\n<li>See if there’s a RESTful version of the service available that you can talk to (bypassing JSR 172 all together)<\/li>\r\n<li>Create an intermediate web service that translates the incompatible data types to compatible data types<\/li>\r\n<li>Write your own SOAP handler to handle the unsupported data types<\/li>\r\n<li>Use third-party libraries such as kSOAP 2 to manage communication with the service<\/li>\r\n<li>Other options as appropriate (wouldn’t want to get poked for missing one)<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>It’s unlikely you’ll be able to get a developer to build you a new version of the service, but it’s possible. I’d suggest copious amounts of Mountain Dew and doughnuts applied liberally.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>You could use REST as a way to do this, assuming there was a RESTful version available, but since we’re talking about SOAP-based web services it’s probably reasonable to assume if there was a RESTful version available that you’d be using it and not reading my articles.<br \/>The most common solution in my experience is to create a wrapper service that makes the translation between the data types for you. There’s a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Design_pattern_(computer_science)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Design Pattern<\/a> for this and a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Adapter_pattern\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wrapper\/Adaptor pattern<\/a> to make it easy.&nbsp; What happens then is you build the wrapper service to accommodate your needs here. The wrapper service exposes supported data types for the stub generator and behind the scenes, calls the original web service on your application’s behalf.<\/p>\r\n<p>This method works even if you’re consuming a web service provided by someone else (some other organization). It shouldn’t care that you’re consuming their service from a service – that’s the whole beauty of web services – they’re designed to be chained together and consumed in different ways.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, that’s all I have for this installment. I know you’re expecting me to show you how to do this, but it’s really not the focus of this series – I’m merely trying to demonstrate how a Domino developer can expose Domino web services to a BlackBerry Java application. I’m sure there are a bunch of examples out there of how to use the Wrapper design pattern.<\/p>\r\n<p>I still have to write the article on how to write the Java application that talks to the web service. I’d planned to write that article today, but thought Brendan’s predicament was a good one to address.&nbsp; I should get the next article done pretty soon. I found out that I have to start looking for a new job&nbsp; last week (more on that later) so I’m a little distracted, but I should be able to wrap up this series pretty soon.

I started out writing software programs to automate Physics experiments for the University of Akron then branched out into consulting, working for several different firms until I got my job at Research In Motion.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>I became a Novell Certified Netware Engineer then Novell Certified Netware Instructor. When I began my Lotus Notes career &ndash; I quickly became a Lotus Certified Notes Instructor (one of the first batch certified outside of Lotus). Because of this, I spent a great many years as a full time instructor and finely tuned my presentation skills.<\/p>\r\n<p>My first big accomplishment was an IBM Beacon Award for Biggest Business Impact in 1997 for an application I helped design for Key Bank. We designed and built a system for managing the merchant setup process for credit card processing. The system we built decreased the merchant setup process from 12 to 5 days and involved a very complicated series of integrations with mainframe-based systems all over the US. It was an expensive application to build, but generated a significant return on investment for the bank.<\/p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve created several commercial software products using Borland (now Embarcadero) Delphi as well as Lotus Notes\/Domino.&nbsp; The most successful Domino one is a product called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wolcottgroup.com\/adt\/\" target=\"_blank\">Automated Deployment Toolkit (ADT) for Lotus Notes<\/a>. It was an IBM Beacon Award winner in 2002 in the Best Tool\/Utility category. It&rsquo;s a product that is still sold today and has been a very successful product for Wolcott Group. For ADT, I did all of the initial product development &ndash; building it into a full, commercial product before bringing on additional developers to help maintain and support the product. I was ultimately responsible for development, sales, support, documentation and managing our relationships with partners including IBM (ADT&rsquo;s biggest reseller).<\/p>\r\n<p>I created <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wolcottgroup.com\/products\/software\/configsave\/\" target=\"_blank\">ConfigSave for Lotus Notes<\/a> &ndash; a tool that allowed you to save and restore Notes configurations and easily switch between configurations. In 2002 it won the <a href=\"http:\/\/my.advisor.com\/articles.nsf\/aid\/olsee211-s\" target=\"_blank\">Lotus Advisor Magazine award for Cool New Tool<\/a>. I also created ClientSync &ndash; a more reliable competitor for the roaming capabilities IBM added to Notes in an earlier version.<\/p>\r\n<p>My favorite commercial application I created is a product called Official&rsquo;s Record Keeper (ORK) &ndash; an application for managing all of the data a sports official needs to track. There&rsquo;s a free trial version available for download or it can be purchased <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mcnellysoftworks.com\/html\/official_s_record_keeper.html\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>. If you know of any sports officials, please send them that link.<\/p>\r\n<p>As an employee at RIM, I worked with AT&amp;T to support their customers with building BlackBerry applications. I regularly educated customers on the capabilities of the platform and made sure they had everything they needed to build these apps. I became then a subject matter expert on the capabilities of the platform and the tools available to build the apps.&nbsp; It's these skills that prepared me for writing the book. My enterprise application experience gave me just the right skills to understand exactly what they were going through. I applied the same customer service attitude I used with my software products to make sure every customer was taken care of.<\/p>\r\n<p>Through all of this, I became a very detail oriented and reliable project and product manager, writer and presenter. As I mentioned, I&rsquo;m looking for contract work immediately &ndash; either project management, Domino, Delphi or BlackBerry development or delivering training classes.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d be most interested in doing BlackBerry development work (a bonus but not a requirement would be for it to be on Domino).&nbsp; For the long term, I&rsquo;m looking for a position leveraging any of my skills. I&rsquo;m ultimately interested in becoming Director of Mobile Development for the right company but will do any type of work as long as it exercises my brain, leverages existing skills and\/or helps me gain new skills.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you know of anything or hear of anything, please let me know &ndash; you can use the &lsquo;Contact Me&rsquo; link in the navigation area on the left to contact me.&nbsp; Thanks for listening (reading).<\/p>\r\n<p>I had a conversation the other day with my good friend <a href=\"http:\/\/lotusgeek.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Rocky Oliver<\/a>.

Of special notice are the stub libraries that were generated for this application:<\/p>\r\n<p>{codecitation class=\"brush:java gutter:false\"}import com.johnwargo.domdirlookup.DomDirLookup_Stub;<br \/>import com.johnwargo.domdirlookup.USERINFO;{\/codecitation}<\/p>\r\n<p>With these classes imported, the application now has access to the objects needed to talk to the web service.&nbsp; In the ContactLookupScreen class, some objects are created that the application needs; mostly a string constant and the BlackBerry fields used on the screen.&nbsp; You should also notice the following:<\/p>\r\n<p>{codecitation class=\"brush:java gutter:false\"}private DomDirLookup_Stub stub;{\/codecitation}<\/p>\r\n<p>It defines an object that instantiates the capabilities provided by the stub class. It’s through this object that the remainder of the code has access to the service.<\/p>\r\n<p>In the constructor for the ContactLookupScreen, the text and fields are added to the screen. The callback method is set to allow the listField to be able to draw itself.<\/p>\r\n<p>The makeMenu method defines the menu items available to the program. It’s called whenever the user presses the menu button on the BlackBerry device.&nbsp; Notice that the ‘Get Contact List’ menu item is only added if there’s something in the editSearch field (it’s non-blank) and the ‘Get Contact Details’ menu item is only added when there’s an item selected in the list of contacts (the editList field). It actually took me a little while to figure this one out. When you select an item in the list, the index for the selected item changes when you scroll off the list to access another field on the screen. If you scrolled up, then getSelectedIndex returns 0 and if you scroll off the bottom of the list, getSelectedIndex returns one less than the total number of items in the list. The result of this then is that you can really only tell if an item is selected in the list when the list actually has focus.<\/p>\r\n<p>Once the screen is all setup, it sits there patiently waiting for the user to do something. When the user enters a search string and presses the menu button, the ‘Get Contact List’ menu item is available and executes the runnable defined in mnuGetContacts.&nbsp; The first thing it does is clear out the list of contacts left over from a previous search. It then checks to see if the stub has been initialized yet:<\/p>\r\n<p>{codecitation class=\"brush:java gutter:false\"}if (stub == null) {<br \/>&nbsp; stub = new DomDirLookup_Stub();<br \/>}{\/codecitation}<\/p>\r\n<p>After that, it makes the call to GETUSERLIST and passes in the text types into the editSearch field:<\/p>\r\n<p>{codecitation class=\"brush:java gutter:false\"}\/\/ Call the GetUserList function<br \/>userList = stub.GETUSERLIST(editSearch.getText());<br \/>\/\/ did we get any contacts back?<br \/>if (userList.length &gt; 0) {<br \/>&nbsp; \/\/ For some reason the web service returns one extra entry,<br \/>&nbsp; \/\/ so we'll just skip the first entry in the array.<br \/>&nbsp; for (i = 0; i &lt; userList.length; i++) {<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \/\/ Make room in the list box for the element<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; editList.insert(i);<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \/\/ Then add the contact name to the list<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myCallback.insert(userList[i].toString(), i);<br \/>&nbsp; }<br \/>&nbsp; \/\/ Select the first item in the list<br \/>&nbsp; editList.setSelectedIndex(0);<br \/>} else {<br \/>&nbsp; \/\/Tell the user when there are no results<br \/>&nbsp; Status.show(\"No contacts found.\");<br \/>}{\/codecitation}<\/p>\r\n<p>When the user selects a contact in the list returned from the call to GETUSERLIST and presses the BlackBerry menu button, the ‘Get Contact Details’ menu item is available and executes the runnable defined in mnuGetContact:<\/p>\r\n<p>{codecitation class=\"brush:java gutter:false\"}\/\/create a USERINFO object to hold the contact details <br \/>\/\/returned by the call to GetUserDetails<br \/>USERINFO userInfo; <br \/>\/\/Just in case, make sure we have a selected item<br \/>if (editList.getSelectedIndex() &gt; -1) {<br \/>&nbsp; try {<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \/\/Call the web service, get the contact details<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; userInfo = stub.GETUSERDETAILS(myCallback.get(editList, editList.getSelectedIndex()).toString());<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; app.pushScreen(new ContactDetailsScreen(userInfo));&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br \/>&nbsp; } catch (Exception ex) {<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dialog.alert(\"Unable to connect to service. Service returned:\\n\" + ex.toString());<br \/>&nbsp; }<br \/>}{\/codecitation}<\/p>\r\n<p>In this case, it first creates an object to hold the UserInfo information returned by the web service then calls the GETUSERDETAILS method in the stub object passing in the name of the selected contact.&nbsp; As soon as it gets a result back from the web service, it creates the ContactDetailsScreen and displays it.<\/p>\r\n<p>The ContactDetailsScreen is defined in the ContactDetailsScreen.java file in the project as shown below:<\/p>\r\n<p>{codecitation class=\"brush:java gutter:true\"}package com.johnwargo.contactlookup;<br \/><br \/>import net.rim.device.api.system.Characters;<br \/>import net.rim.device.api.ui.component.ActiveRichTextField;<br \/>import net.rim.device.api.ui.component.LabelField;<br \/>import net.rim.device.api.ui.container.*;<br \/><br \/>import com.johnwargo.domdirlookup.USERINFO;<br \/><br \/>final class ContactDetailsScreen extends MainScreen {<br \/><br \/>&nbsp; public ContactDetailsScreen( USERINFO contactInfo ) {<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; super(DEFAULT_MENU | DEFAULT_CLOSE);<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; setTitle(new LabelField(\"Contact Details\", LabelField.ELLIPSIS | LabelField.USE_ALL_WIDTH));<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; add(new LabelField(\"Full Name:\"));<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; addActiveField(contactInfo.getFULLNAME().toString());<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; add(new LabelField(\"Office Phone:\"));<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; addActiveField(contactInfo.getOFFICEPHONE().toString());<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; add(new LabelField(\"Mobile Phone:\"));<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; addActiveField(contactInfo.getMOBILEPHONE().toString());<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; add(new LabelField(\"Email Address:\"));<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; addActiveField(contactInfo.getEMAILADDRESS().toString());<br \/>&nbsp; }<br \/><br \/>&nbsp; public void addActiveField(String strValue) {<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \/\/Create a temporary field<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveRichTextField tmpField;<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \/\/Create the field<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tmpField = new ActiveRichTextField(strValue);<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \/\/Make it read only<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tmpField.setEditable(false);<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \/\/Add the field to the screen<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; add(tmpField);<br \/>&nbsp; }<br \/><br \/>&nbsp; protected boolean keyChar(char c, int status, int time) {<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \/\/ Override keyChar to make sure Escape doesn't prompt to save changes.<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (c == Characters.ESCAPE) {<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this.setDirty(false);<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return super.keyChar(c, status, time);<br \/>&nbsp; }<br \/>&nbsp; <br \/>}{\/codecitation}<\/p>\r\n<p>What happens here is pretty straight forward. The screen is created and fields for each of the values returned by the web service are added. Notice that the application uses an ActiveRichTextField to display the field values. This is because the ActiveRichTextField automatically formats phone numbers, email addresses, web URL’s, device PIN’s as clickable areas allowing the user to click on one of these items to perform actions such as calling the selected phone number, sending an email to the selected address and so on. You don’t have to do it this way for all fields; I just did them all the same way to make the application as simple as possible.<\/p>\r\n<p>That’s it – that’s the program. For your own application, you’ll need to plug in your stub class, initialize the stub and plug away.<\/p>\r\n<h1>Running the Application<\/h1>\r\n<p>When you test the application in the simulator from your development environment, depending on the version of the BlackBerry Device Software you’re running the application could appear in different places.

It is not meant to be a production quality application nor is it designed to cover every possible for this type of application. All is does is leverage the support for JSR 172 added in BlackBerry Device Software 4.3 to access the Domino Web Service. Before you can release an application like this into production, you must make accommodation for one or more of the following:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Network Connection – The application doesn’t make any accommodation&nbsp; for the type of network connection you want to use to connect to the Domino server. I’m not really sure how to do this on the BlackBerry when using JSR 172, but the end user has several connections available to them (MDS, BIS-B, Wi-Fi, WAP) and it may make sense to expend some effort determining the right connection to use for the best quality of service and smallest cost to the user.&nbsp; According to a knowledge base article I found, all you need to do is append the appropriate connection parameters in the service URL (in the stub) but I haven’t confirmed this.<\/li>\r\n<li>Threading model – Because this is just a sample application, the calls to the Web Service are made on the main thread. For a production application, the calls should be made on a separate thread to ensure that regular application processing isn’t interrupted while the connection is made to the Domino server.<\/li>\r\n<li>Authenticating against a secure service – The service I setup for this example was not configured to require credentials for access.&nbsp; In your production application, you may need to have the user authenticate before they can access the service.<\/li>\r\n<li>Signing the application – Because of the libraries used in this application, the application must be signed by Research In Motion before it will run on an actual device. Signing an application is easy, it’s all built into the BlackBerry Java development tools. All you need to do is plunk down the $20 to purchase a set of signing keys and you’re all set to go.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>You’ll probably also want to have the application clear the contact list when the user begins typing a value for the search string. <br \/><br \/><\/p>\r\n<h1>In the Next Installment<\/h1>\r\n<p>Well, I wasn’t planning on another installment – this is supposed to be the end of this article series.&nbsp; I’ve got a long list of topics I want to cover, but let me know what else you’d like me to write about.<\/p>","state":"1","catid":"2","created":"2009-10-04 11:00:00","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2022-11-11 22:30:07","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2009-10-04 11:00:00","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"16","ordering":"48","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"23801","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

Well, I started building a repository of information about BlackBerry development-related topics - I'm going to launch the site on November 1st, stay tuned for additional information.<\/p>\r\n<p>As I worked on the book, I found different articles on RIM's web site and elsewhere that helped me learn the topic better or reinforce some of the content. At the end of each chapter, I added an Additional Resources section that listed each of these links. One of my reviewers from RIM suggested that I post those links online so they will be easier to access by the book's readers. I setup a special section of the book's web site and posted all of the links last night. You can access the links at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbdevfundamentals.com\/index.php\/inside-the-book\/mnuaddlresources\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.bbdevfundamentals.com\/index.php\/inside-the-book\/mnuaddlresources<\/a>.

The Developer Journal was a cool publication because the topics were covered thoroughly in long articles. They were full of pictures and source code.

I've been told that the Journal articles have been made available as Knowledge Base articles - but I haven't checked to see if they all made it.

{"id":"73","asset_id":"110","title":"The President's BlackBerry","alias":"president","introtext":"<p>I've always been a little perplexed about everyone freaking out about Obama's BlackBerry. It always surprised me that everyone was writing articles about how he had to give up his BlackBerry because of security reasons.&nbsp; Security reasons? It's the most secure mobile device in the market - how could there be security concerns? The headline of every single article I read referenced said security concern but didn’t really give the details. It just didn't make sense.&nbsp; Let's think about it a bit.<\/p>\r\n<p>The device is so freaking secure that it verifies the security signatures of the OS and the application platform when it starts up. No concern there, right? If a signature was invalid, the device would brick – not even complete the startup process. Even if someone could get their hands on the device, it wouldn’t work unless the person who mucked with it had access to the internal signing keys and algorithms that Research In Motion uses in its manufacturing process. I’m pretty sure it’s in Research In Motion’s business plan to protect them at all costs – any failure on this front and the BlackBerry device couldn’t be used by any government in the world and any security conscious company. Nope, no worries there.<\/p>\r\n","fulltext":"\r\n<p>An administrator can configure the device so everything is encrypted on the device using US Government approved encryption protocols. No concern there, right? I remember reading somewhere that It’s even so encrypted that when certain critical information such as a password data is held in memory chips that it’s encrypted there – so if someone got their hands on his device and hooked it up to a logic probe – all they would get is the encrypted version of the data. Oh, by the way, the data is encrypted using keys unique to the device - so there’s no reverse engineering one device and using the discovered keys on another device.&nbsp; They keys are renegotiated periodically too and there’s even a session key that’s created for every single message sent to\/from the device.<\/p>\r\n<p>Yep, pretty secure so far.<\/p>\r\n<p>All of the data transmitted between the President’s device and the White House’s BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) is encrypted (both ways) using US Government approved security protocols. At no time is any of his data unencrypted until it gets INSIDE of the White House firewall. Yep, no worries there either, right?<\/p>\r\n<p>I’m not sure about Verizon and Sprint’s network, but on EDGE (the network used by AT&amp;T and T-Mobile in the US), the transmitted data is encrypted during transmission. Yep, even though the BlackBerry encrypts it, the wireless carrier encrypts it again on the wireless network.&nbsp; No concerns there, right? It’s not US Government approved encryption, but it’s an encryption on top of a US Government approved encryption protocol. Ya, it’s probably OK.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, what’s the big concern?<\/p>\r\n<p>I’m not sure if this is really it, but I have been reading <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0470159405?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mcnsof-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0470159405\" rel=\"noopener\">BlackBerry Planet: The Story of Research in Motion and the Little Device that Took the World by Storm (Wiley)<\/a><img src=\"http:\/\/www.assoc-amazon.com\/e\/ir?t=mcnsof-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0470159405\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" \/> by Alastair Sweeny and came across something interesting.&nbsp; The book is supposed to be about the history of Research In Motion, but so far, it’s a big discussion of BlackBerry addiction and about Obama’s issues with the BlackBerry. Not what I expected. I already know about BlackBerry addition and honestly, except for this particular article, I really don’t care about the President’s BlackBerry device woes.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, I digress – so in the book, he said:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\"The Secret Service and the National Security Agency say that the main danger to the president lay with the cellular radio in the device, which constantly syncs with nearby wireless networks so calls can be routed to the phone. If bad guys ever got access to the cell phone systems that handled Obama’s BlackBerry, they might be able to ping his smartphone to a wireless tower and track his movements. Or they could scan cellular frequencies over several days to triangulate his exact position, even down to one of several identical limousines, even though they could not decode the AES-128 encrypted BlackBerry data.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Having just received certification as a BlackBerry administrator (BES 4.1 and 5.0 thank you), I happen to know that it’s 256-bit key, but that’s not important right now. AES has a fixed block size of 128 bits, but uses a 128-bit, 192-bit or 256-bit key. I’m pretty sure the White House has selected the 256-bit key; if they haven’t, they’re just not thinking.<\/p>\r\n<p>OK, anyway – so someone interested in doing something bad to the President wants to know where he is.&nbsp; Hmmm, interesting. So, the assumption is that Obama has a BlackBerry and somehow he’s identifiable. Well, he’s surrounded by people who have BlackBerry devices, so how do you identify him out of all of the devices that are around him? You know his staff carries them, his wife carries one, it’s likely that the Secret Service detail carries them. How do you really know it’s him? Well, the premise I guess is that the criminals have gotten access to the mobile equipment (I won’t be calling it cellular equipment because I guess I expected that most people stopped calling it a cellular network when it transitioned from an analog to an entirely digital network) nearby where the president is. In the book passage, they’ve gotten access in order to identify his limo, right?&nbsp; Well, wait a minute. So to accurately triangulate, you have to be able to have access to three towers, right? So here’s the President, his staff, his security detail – oh and all the tens or hundreds of people in the immediate vicinity around them who are all carrying BlackBerry devices and you have to get access to at least three towers and be able to pick out 1 device in 100 or more?&nbsp; Really?<\/p>\r\n<p>Doesn’t make sense to me.<\/p>\r\n<p>Did I mention that all of the BlackBerry device data is encrypted in transit? Did I also mention that the carrier’s network usually encrypts it as well?&nbsp; How in the heck are you going to be able to identify a single device out of a hundred devices when all (every single bit) of the data being transmitted is being encrypted? I’m just not getting it. You might say that they’ll somehow identify his device when he’s making a phone call. I don’t know about you, but I don’t expect the President of the United States to be making a bunch of mobile phone calls on his BlackBerry when he clearly has even more secure voice communications available to him. But, did I mention that the carrier encrypts the signal between the device and the network?&nbsp; Yep, even voice data if I remember correctly.<\/p>\r\n<p>I am just not getting it. It’s probably possible, but whoever did it would have to be very sophisticated and it would take a lot of work and coordination plus a bunch of very expensive tech. I know the NSA could probably do it but who knows – we all think they can crack anything when it’s entirely possible they can’t crack anything and they keep criminals at bay with fear, uncertainly and doubt (FUD). No way of knowing.<\/p>\r\n<p>OK, this was just a mental exercise on my part. I’m not a security expert; I’m just a BlackBerry guy who found this an interesting topic to write about. I’m just telling a story here. I was just amazed by all of the press back in December and January and was happy that someone finally tried to explain it. All the articles I read provoked the sensationalism and never explained that the BlackBerry was secure, it was other things the NSA was worried about. I don’t know if this guy is right and I doubt I will ever find out. While I didn’t vote for the guy, I think he’s very smart and will ultimately be a very good president (while spending more of my money than I would allow if I could, but that’s another story). I have no issues with him or his administration and I harbor no ill will toward him and his family.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Let me know what you think. Fill in some blanks for me. Ignore me, agree with me or prove me wrong – I’m curious what other people think about this topic. If you’re going to disagree with me or prove me wrong, please be polite doing it. I’m rather sensitive<\/p>\r\n<p>Part II<\/p>\r\n<p>OK, so I started looking around for articles about this topic and came across this:&nbsp; <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.networkworld.com\/community\/node\/37482\" rel=\"noopener\">Three reasons why Obama's BlackBerry is a national security THREAT<\/a>. Having read through this article two things pop out – one is that the author doesn’t understand the BlackBerry platform very well and the second is that he’s assuming that criminals would have physical access to the device. Sorry, not likely. It’s all this ridiculous sensationalism generated by the media and others that’s causing this problem.<\/p>\r\n<p>He argues that there were 9 vulnerabilities in the last three years, so the President’s device would get hacked three times a year for four years. Huh? Just because the vulnerabilities exist doesn’t mean they haven’t been patched and again a criminal would need access first to take advantage of them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>He argues that anyone with $100 could get keys that would allow them to write malware that would affect the President’s device. Huh? Um, the keys have been $20 for almost 2 years. And, sure I could write a piece of malware, anyone could – but how do you get your malware installed on the President’s device? You think he’s trolling the Internet looking for cool applications to install on his device? Seriously?&nbsp; Ok, want to buy a bridge? I have one for sale, it’s in NY Harbor, but you can move it anywhere you want once your check clears.<\/p>\r\n<p>He points to a Wikipedia article about determining the location of a mobile device – yep, it’s called e911 and it’s federally mandated.&nbsp; It’s all about the carrier (the guys who are running the wireless network) being able to locate a device they’re already talking to.&nbsp; It’s not about hijacking the location of the device – it’s about identifying the device (because they’ve called 911) and being able to tell the emergency call center where the caller is located.&nbsp; I may be ignorant, but I don’t see the connection here.<\/p>\r\n<p>He refers to a roaming phone tap used in some mafia trial – yep, it was roaming alright, it was a physical transmitter physically implanted in the suspect’s phone. Yep, needed physical access to the device to be able to install the hardware. When the President says ‘you can have this when&nbsp; you pry it from my hands’ do you think that means it will be easy to implant the transmitter? If you can get close enough to implant a transmitter in the President’s smartphone, you probably already have the access you need to do bad things.<\/p>\r\n<p>He even for some bizarre reason argues that one would need to maintain a database of malware information and regularly check for it on the device. Not true – with a few very simple (simple, seriously – I promise) you can completely lock down a BlackBerry device and protect it from any malware. Because of the security capabilities of the BlackBerry device – there’s a reduced need for antivirus software on the BlackBerry. <br \/>Every single one of you should immediately go to www.blackberry.com\/security and do some reading. There are a couple of very simple settings you can set on the device – the first of which is the most important. Disable access to any third party applications. There, got it set? OK then, nobody can install any malware on your device. Even if the user physically cables the device to a computer and tries to manually install ANY application – it won’t install and it definitely wouldn’t run on the device. Done, done and done. Next!<\/p>\r\n<p>There’s an option to support white listing of applications as a way to block all applications then specifically list the ones that are allowed – but that’s still pretty secure. If the President tries to install an application with a digital signature different than any of the applications on the white list, it won’t install – nope, just won’t.<\/p>\r\n<p>Next you turn on encryption to all data on the device is encrypted at all times. Got it done? Ok, then even if someone gains physical access to the device, they can’t see ANYTHING on the device without NSA level decryption capabilities (which could or could not exist, who knows).<\/p>\r\n<p>Now, in an article called <em>Obama's BlackBerry Security Strategy<\/a> (since removed) it says:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\"According to Mitnick, who is credited with hacking Motorola, Nokia, Sun Microsystems, FBI, and Pentagon networks (among many others,) the best course of action for a hacker would probably be to infiltrate the personal computer of somebody close to Obama. Then, the hacker would have to use that person's identity to divert Obama to a compromised website that would upload malicious code onto the BlackBerry.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>More sensationalism, argh! Nope, can’t be done. You turn on setting about restricting all third party applications then none of this is possible. Even if he could get redirected to a malicious web site by someone who’s impersonating a friend ‘Hey Barack, I just found this amazing downloads site for BlackBerry applications – check out the cool new Bass Fisherman application, you’ll love it!’ there’s no way he’d do it. Never, not in a million years. He was barely able to keep his BlackBerry device – you think he didn’t make any promises to the NSA to be allowed to keep it? I am pretty sure that one of them was ‘yep, I promise not to download any applications off of the Internet onto my super secure device.’<\/p>\r\n<p>Here’s another one: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/story\/0,2933,483005,00.html\" rel=\"noopener\">Microsoft: Obama's BlackBerry Is Security Risk<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>This one is at least accurate – yes, every single message the President sends from his BlackBerry device does leave the country – it travels through a Network Operations Center (NOC) maintained by Research In Motion in one or more locations around the globe. It’s true, and it is a potential security risk, but if you keep in mind that first of all, Research In Motion has passed every single relevant security certification for the device and has passed many security audits in its data center – you’d have to know that the data is secure. Remember, everyone around the president and most of the important people in the US Government are already carrying BlackBerry devices and all that traffic goes through Research In Motion’s data centers – what seriously are the chances that it can be intercepted?&nbsp; Remember, the device uses US Government approved encryption protocols, the only entities that know the keys are the device and the BES and the session key is changed with every single message that is sent. It’s secure.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, that’s my little rant for today. I hope you enjoyed it. Again though, I’m just musing about this whole security thing. Of course, having worked for Research In Motion, I’m a little biased in my opinion here but I do trust the certifications and validations of the BlackBerry security. Again, just my thoughts – I’m not a security expert. Please be polite if you’re going to blast me.<br \/><br \/><\/p>","state":"1","catid":"2","created":"2009-10-07 21:17:12","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2019-06-26 11:16:14","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2009-10-07 21:17:12","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"15","ordering":"46","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"8821","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

When you open a connection to the server, if the ACL restricts anonymous access, then the web server (the Domino HTTP process) is going to return an HTTP response code of 403. Your application then needs to prompt for credentials (you could store them in the program and pass them every time if you want) then reconnect to the server passing in the credentials in the HTTP headers for the request. I'm not sure exactly how to do that within the stub, but it's standard HTTP authentication, so it should be documented anywhere.","fulltext":"","state":"-2","catid":"11","created":"2009-10-08 23:56:21","created_by":"63","created_by_alias":"John Wargo","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2023-03-17 18:01:17","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"1","ordering":"1","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"1277","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

I approved the final cover today (although we're waiting to hear back from RIM to see whether they have an issue with using the BlackBerry Curve 8900 device image on the cover) and I'm staring at the final manuscript - giving it one final review. The plan, as I understand it, is to finish the manuscript this week (Friday) and send it to the printer. It's expected to be out of the printer and in stock in the warehouse in about three weeks. They've got some little changes to make based upon my review this evening and apparently they're working on the index in parallel. I think, but I'm not sure that I'll be holding a printed copy of the book in my hot little hands in about a week. I can't wait.<\/p>\r\n<p>We ended up not having enough room for all of the sample applications and the book's two appendices, so they'll all be up on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbdevfundamentals.com\" target=\"_blank\">the book's web site<\/a>. The book weighed in at about 600 pages which was way more than the publisher bargained for. By removing some screen shots and moving some of the content to the book's web site, we got it down to about 450 pages. Still a lot of content when you look at it and I'm still amazed that I wrote so many pages. It was the most technical writing I've ever done (and I've done quite a bit of technical writing in my life). All told, when the book goes to the printer on Friday, it will have been 10 months and 15 days since I wrote the first word of the first chapter.<\/p>\r\n<p>Local BlackBerry expert Ben Pijor asked to interview me for an article in an online publication, so I finished that up yesterday morning - expect to see it on or about the time the book pops into the warehouse. His questions were spot on and I really enjoyed answering them.

I loved Norton Utilities and have used Norton Antivirus (all of its different flavors) ever since I got on Windows. I have to say though that I'm done with it, just done.&nbsp; I have kepy updating my subscription every year, but this last version (2009 I guess) was absolutely horrible. I had to disable so many of its features to be able to use my HP network printer and FireFox was never the same after one of its updates. With FireFox, when I start it up on my desktop, it takes several minutes before it will respond to anything I do. It's not like that on any other machine I use, but only on the one running Norton Internet Security.<\/p>\r\n<p>Well, my subscription ran out a while ago and the final straw for me was this:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/norton1.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>It's telling me I need to renew, but it's giving me a rediculously limited number of options.

I was trying to decide what I wanted to do with this, so I had to fire up Task Manager and kill the task to get it to stop reminding me every day. As soon as I reboot my machine, it starts reminding me again and again and again. Enough already - it's unfair to consumers to be this relentless; all it's doing is making me want to use somebody else's product.

I use Qurb to block spam messages in my personal email account, I've found it to be very reliable - which is easy when you build a whitelist product. No false positives when everything is done against a whitelist.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, a while back I got this really interesting scam message indicating that it was from the IRS offering me access to a bigger refund if I filled out a form. A quick disection of the email showed that it had nothing to do with the IRS (I wasn't fooled for a second, I promise). Yesterday I got the following email:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/spam-msg.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>I truly wonder how many people fall for these types of emails. If you're not technical, you probably think nothing of it and click away. Knowing that I'm the only person at McNelly SoftWorks (it's my home business) it was easy to know that I didn't send the email message. I give the spammer\/scammer credit for trying to make a pretty believable email message. If you think about it though, anyone who thinks about it should be able to easily see through the facade, right? What company would identify their support organization by their internet domain? If the message was from McNelly SoftWorks rather than mcnellysoftworks.com it's possible that it's a real message - but any company that sent the message would know to use the company name. So, even though the spammer\/scammer appeared smart at the start, it's clear that they didn't think about what they were doing.<\/p>\r\n<p>I've started making a habit of looking for my first name in any suspect email message. If it's addressed to my email address, I know immediately it's a scam. My bank and other companies I do business with know to address me as John. Any ebay, amazon, facebook email has got to have my name in the salutation (not my email address) in order for me to read it.<\/p>\r\n<p>Of course, if you look at the code begind the link, at first pass it does seem like a valid URL because it begins with mcnellsoftworks.com.

As RIM reviewed the chapters, several people commented on how, even if JavaScript was turned off in the browser, it could be enabled programmatically. I searched and searched for information about how to do this, but couldn't find anything until I finally begged someone from RIM to explain to me how to do it. Here's how it's done:<\/p>\r\n<p>In the NoScript section of an HTML page, put in some JavaScript. It doesn't have to be script that does anything, it just has to be JavaScript. When the browser encounters the JavaScript, it sees that it's disabled and prompts the user to enable it.<\/p>\r\n<p>Here's a sample web page that enables this:{codecitation class=\"brush:html; gutter:false\"}&lt;!DOCTYPE html public \"-\/\/W3C\/\/DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional\/\/EN\"&gt;<br \/> &lt;HTML&gt;<br \/> &lt;HEAD&gt;<br \/> &lt;TITLE&gt;JavaScript Test&lt;\/TITLE&gt;<br \/> &lt;\/HEAD&gt;<br \/> &lt;\/HEAD&gt;<br \/> &lt;BODY&gt;<br \/>&lt;h1&gt;JavaScript Test&lt;\/h1&gt;<br \/> &lt;SCRIPT type=\"text\/javascript\"&gt;<br \/> document.write(\"JavaScript is enabled!\")<br \/> &lt;\/SCRIPT&gt;<br \/> &lt;NOSCRIPT&gt;<br \/> JavaScript is disabled!&lt;br \/&gt;<br \/> Please &lt;A href=\"javascript:void()\"&gt;click here&lt;\/A&gt; to enable JavaScript.<br \/> &lt;\/NOSCRIPT&gt;<br \/> &lt;\/BODY&gt;<br \/> &lt;\/HTML&gt;{\/codecitation}<\/p>\r\n<p>What's interesting about how this works is that MDS will normally process the HTML page and remove any content not supported by the browser - it doesn't make any sense to send anything to the browser that the browser won't recognize. So, it the HTTP Accepts header indicates that JavaScript is not enabled, then MDS will remove all of the JavaScript code from the page. Since JavaScript isn't expected to be in the &lt;NoScript&gt; area of the page, MDS ignores it and delivers that script to the browser. When the link is clicked, the browser performs its check and prompts the user to enable JavaScript.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Pretty cool, right?<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"2","created":"2009-10-26 13:43:44","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2009-10-26 13:43:44","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"3","ordering":"42","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"11208","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

One of the things they mention in some of the books is that to avoid file ownership problems, you should configure Joomla to use FTP to upload files. I have been trying to get the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.joomlacontenteditor.net\/\" target=\"_blank\">Joomla Content Editor (JCE)<\/a> installed (with NO success) so I thought I'd try this configuration option to see if it helped me with my JCE problems.<\/p>\r\n<p>I pulled out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0137012314?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mcnsof-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0137012314\">Joomla! 1.5: A User's Guide: Building a Successful Joomla! Powered Website (2nd Edition)<\/a> and looked up the page covering FTP settings and found...nothing. Just a screen shot and no explanation of how this should actually be configured. So, I created an FTP account for Joomla and went into the Joomla Server configuration to enable the settings. Here's a picture of the settings page:<\/p>\r\n<p><img class=\"caption\" src=\"images\/stories\/joomla ftp.png\" border=\"0\" title=\"Joomla FTP Settings\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>I had the FTP account configured, but I couldn't figure out what to do with the 'FTP Root' field. Originally I configured the FTP account so it's root was the root folder for the particular Joomla implementation. I did this assuming that Joomla would want to login and see it's own folder structure. Nope, wrong approach. What I had to do was configure the FTP client to use the domain's root folder as it's root folder then leave the FTP root folder blank in the dialog shown above. That way, both Joomla and the FTP login are looking at the same folder structure.<\/p>\r\n<p>It took me some trail and error to figure this out. I mentioned the book wasn't any help and the field help didn't tell me anything - so that's why I decided to write about it here.<\/p>\r\n<p>I still can't get JCE installed. the tool's web site says I should use Joomla's installation tools (doesn't work) and the manual installation instructions if the automated install doesn't work.

{"id":"100","asset_id":"135","title":"BlackBerry Development Books","alias":"bb-dev-books","introtext":"<p>OK, so if you're reading my blog you've probably already figured out that I wrote a book on BlackBerry development called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbdevfundamentals.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"BlackBerry Development Fundamentals\" rel=\"noopener\">BlackBerry Development Fundamentals<\/a>. I've been keeping my eye on the market, watching what new books become available (mostly because I wanted to be able to say I published the first book dedicated to the topic (I did)). To make it easier for people looking for books about BlackBerry, just yesterday I launched <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blackberrybooks.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"blackberrybooks.org\" rel=\"noopener\">blackberrybooks.org<\/a>, a site containing information on all of the available BlackBerry books. As I spent some time this morning populating the site I noticed that even more books were coming out early next year so I thought I'd share a little bit about what I know about these books:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>BlackBerry Development Fundamentals<\/strong>: This is the ultimate getting started guide for BlackBerry developers. If you need\/want to get into BlackBerry development, this is the book that will explain to you everything that the platform can do, how to optimize your applications for the platform and how to build applications using the free tools available to you. It's not a heavy duty coding book, it's a book about what it does, how it works and how to do it. There's code samples in there (especially for the BlackBerry Java development chapters), but it is more about giving you a base understanding of the capabilities, features and especially limitations of the platform.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Beginning BlackBerry Development<\/strong> (By Anthony Rizk): Although the title doesn't say this (Anthony said that the publisher was adamant that the title matched their other books rather than say what the book is actually about) this is a BlackBerry Java development book. The book contains everything a developer would need to know to get started with building BlackBerry Java applications. I haven't read it yet (my copy only arrived yesterday) but from what Anthony told me, it was designed to be a series of lessons that help you learn how to build BlackBerry Java applications. Anthony maintains his own BlackBerry development web site called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thinkingblackberry.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thinking BlackBerry<\/a> and just started a software company called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zeebu.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zeebu Mobile<\/a>.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Advanced BlackBerry Development<\/strong> (<span class=\"ptBrand\">by Chris King): This book is supposed to be out by the end of the year and is designed to be a sort of sequel to <em>Beginning BlackBerry Development<\/em>. It is also a BlackBerry Java development book and it covers advanced topics beyond what Anthony covered in his. I'll be writing more about this book on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blackberrybooks.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.blackberrybooks.org<\/a> once I receive my copy.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li><span class=\"ptBrand\"><strong>BlackBerry All-in-One For Dummies <\/strong>(by Dante Sarigumba, Robert Kao, William Petz &amp; Timothy Calabro): This book isn't really a developer book although it is supposed to have some development topics covered in it. It's designed to take a whole bunch of Dummies books and wrap them all up in a single cover. I can't imagine that this book will be useful to anyone other than to a very beginning BlackBerry developer or one just wants to understand a little bit about how it works. Don't expect a book that covers user, admin and developer topics in the same volume to be any good (sorry)<br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"ptBrand\"><br \/>If you think about it, with the first three books you've got the whole gamut covered - beginning through advanced.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"ptBrand\">This morning I discovered some additional books that will be out early next year, here's a rundown:<br \/><\/span><\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Learning BlackBerry Game Development<\/strong> (by Carol Hamer &amp; Andrew Davison): This book is also a BlackBerry Java development book and is dedicated to game development. It should cover the Java specific topics that apply to BlackBerry development.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Professional BlackBerry Java Development<\/strong> (by David L. Williams): Yet another BlackBerry Java development book. I expect that this one will compete pretty closely with <em>Beginning BlackBerry Development<\/em>.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Beginning Smartphone Web Development: Building JavaScript, CSS, HTML and Ajax-Based Applications for iPhone, Android, Palm Pre, Blackberry, Windows Mobile and Nokia S60<\/strong> (by Gail Frederick): This one isn't a dedicated BlackBerry development book, but covers web development for smartphones.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Pro Smartphone Cross-Platform Development: iPhone, Blackberry, Windows Mobile and Android Development and Distribution<\/strong> (by Sarah Allen &amp;Vidal Graupera): This book seems to cover native cross platform development for smartphones. It's going to be an interesting read because there's no way to build cross platform native applications anymore - the iPhone and Android killed that of all of us (I'll write about this in a little while). I'm not sure what they're going to tell you since the only cross platform application technology available on the devices they list is browser development. We'll see what it says when it comes out.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><br \/>Well, that's it - I'm sure glad I decided to write my book when I did (I started writing December 1, 2008) - it looks like a whole bunch of cool books are on the way and I'm sure more will follow. Right now I know my publisher is looking to write a BlackBerry Java development book and I'm interested in working on it.

{"id":"101","asset_id":"136","title":"Moving a Joomla! Site","alias":"moving-joomla","introtext":"<p>I use Joomla! to manage many of the sites I&rsquo;ve built. It&rsquo;s an open source CMS and it&rsquo;s really pretty cool. As I was building blackberrybooks.org yesterday I made a big mistake and thought I&rsquo;d write about it.<br \/>I host all of my sites on fatcow.com, they&rsquo;re really great and have some amazing tools site administrators like me can use to manage their sites, install open source tools, create databases, create mail accounts and more. One of the tools is something called InstallCentral that basically points to scripts that can be used to install all sorts of open source tools (content management systems, blogs, galleries, forums, e-commerce stuff and more). It was through this tool that I first discovered Joomla! and although Joomla! is pretty easy to install, I&rsquo;ve always just let FatCow&rsquo;s InstallCentral install it.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, yesterday I was working on setting up blackberrybooks.org and I launched the installation like I normally do. When it came time to pick the installation folder, I accepted the default and populated the other fields on the installation form as shown in the following figure:<\/p>\r\n<p><img class=\"caption\" src=\"images\/stories\/joomla install.jpg\" border=\"0\" title=\"FatCow InstallCentral\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>What I forgot to pay attention to was that www.mcnellysoftworks.com actually pointed to a subfolder called &lsquo;home&rsquo; within my FatCow account. That way I can have my &lsquo;home&rsquo; folder and a separate folder for each of the other sites I manage there. So, when InstallCentral installed Joomla!, it dutifully put it exactly where I asked it to be placed and that was &lsquo;\/home\/bbbooks&rsquo;&nbsp; which is not where I wanted it, I wanted it in a folder called &lsquo;\/bbbooks&rsquo; off of the root.<\/p>\r\n<p>After I got the site all up and running and populated all of the book information, I used another cool FatCow tool called &lsquo;Domain Pointing Manager&rsquo; to point www.blackberrybooks.org to the folder where I thought I&rsquo;d installed the site. When I fired up the browser to test the redirect, I got a file not found error message. I quickly fired up an FTP Client (I use FTP Voyager http:\/\/www.ftpvoyager.com\/ from Rhino Software) and looked for the folder and it wasn&rsquo;t there! Ouch. I looked and looked and looked and could not find the Joomla! files where I thought they were supposed to be. It took me a while to figure it out but I finally did and located the files &ndash; right where I didn&rsquo;t want them but right where I&rsquo;d told the installer to put them.<\/p>\r\n<p>Rats, what do I do?<\/p>\r\n<p>Well, I couldn&rsquo;t tear down the site and reinstall then rebuild in the correct location (I know how I&rsquo;m supposed to do it, I just forgot to do it) but on principal that didn&rsquo;t make sense to me. I hate completely redoing something &ndash; it&rsquo;s just not in my nature.<\/p>\r\n<p>I thought perhaps I could just use FatCow&rsquo;s File Manager application to move the files, but I thought perhaps it would somehow not work once I got it moved. Also, I didn&rsquo;t want to have InstallCentral thinking it had an installation where it didn&rsquo;t (my form of OCD) so I couldn&rsquo;t do that.<\/p>\r\n<p>As I thought about it I was suddenly struck by a thought. On a weekly basis I backup all of my sites using JoomlaPack (a free backup utility for Joomla!)- I wondered whether I could use that to backup the site and put it in a new location. I dug out the instruction manual and found to my delight that I could.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, I performed the following steps:<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Backed up my Joomla! installation for the site<\/li>\r\n<li>Copied the backup file to my local hard drive<\/li>\r\n<li>Unzipped the backup file to a temporary folder<\/li>\r\n<li>Uploaded all of the site&rsquo;s files to the \/bbbooks folder on my FatCow account<\/li>\r\n<li>Launched the browser and accessed the site in its new location<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p><br \/>It worked!&nbsp; Woohoo, it worked! So, I now had the files where I needed them and it was working. One of the reasons it was working was that both instances were using the same database table. I knew though that as soon as I uninstalled the Joomla! instance created by InstallCentral it would empty (but not remove) the existing database. Well, that wouldn&rsquo;t work &ndash; when I uninstalled it, I would lose all of my data. So, I went back in and performed the following steps:<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Performed a database backup (because when I uninstall the Joomla! instance,&nbsp;InstallCentral&nbsp;will drop all of the database tables)<\/li>\r\n<li>Uninstalled the Joomla! instance in InstallCentral<\/li>\r\n<li>Restored the database from my local backup<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p><br \/>Who&rsquo;d a thunkit, it worked!!! I got the whole thing moved and the InstallCentral installation list all cleaned up and it&rsquo;s working great.<\/p>\r\n<p>I know, I know, I could have used the FatCow File Manager application to just copy the files to the new location then do the second set of steps, but it was fun to see whether JoomlaPack would do what it was supposed to do (I expected it would, but it was fun to find out).<\/p>\r\n<p>I wrote this article to help others playing with FatCow and Joomla! but probably also to reinforce in my mind that whenever I install another Joomla! instance using InstallCentral, I need to select the Unix root folder name for my FatCow account rather than the high level domain as shown in the figure.<\/p>\r\n<p>I worked on a project a long time ago with a guy by the name of Russ Chung &ndash; he was the most meticulous tech guy I&rsquo;ve ever worked with. Whenever he worked through a problem on the Domino server, he would speak all of the steps as he did them (almost a monologue). The result was that he took his time and walked through all of the steps as he was doing them. I know that if I&rsquo;d taken the time to think while I did the initial install (like Russ would have done) then I could have saved myself all of this work (as fun as it was).<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"8","created":"2009-11-05 18:04:40","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2009-11-06 13:00:00","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"7","ordering":"12","metakey":"Joomla!, JoomlaPack, FatCow, FatCow InstallCentral, Move Joomla","metadesc":"How I used JoomlaPack to move an instance of Joomla!

{"id":"102","asset_id":"137","title":"Internet Scam 2","alias":"internet-scam-2","introtext":"<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I like writing about these Internet email scams, but I just do. I think it&rsquo;s because I know people are responding to them (otherwise they would go away) and that just fascinates me. &nbsp;Here&rsquo;s one I got this morning &ndash; it&rsquo;s so stupid that I&rsquo;m stunned that anyone would even try this approach, but you know what P.T. Barnum said, right?<\/p>\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the email I got:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/internet scam 20091106.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>The good thing is that my ISP recognized the email as Spam (no, Spam is not an acronym, it&rsquo;s a breakfast meat product &ndash; why do people type it in all caps?) and modified the subject of the message on its way to me. Anyone receiving this should benefit from those types of services that ISP&rsquo;s provide.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>I forgot to look at the message headers before I deleted the message. If I&rsquo;d been smart and thought to do that, I&rsquo;d be able to show you the actual email address behind the email message. It&rsquo;s always a good idea to look at the message headers of any suspect email &ndash; it tells you a bit about where the message really came from and what route it took to get to you. Any message from Facebook that started in some Eastern European country is suspect no matter what. Not because Eastern Europe is a dangerous place to get emails from, it&rsquo;s just that Facebook is a US company and it&rsquo;s likely that any message they send me will likely come from a US Server. Right?<\/p>\r\n<p>Now let&rsquo;s look at the email address it was sent to: info@mcnellysoftworks.com. Well, I happen to know that I don&rsquo;t have a Facebook account registered using that email address. That&rsquo;s my next clue that it&rsquo;s junk email.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The subject of the email makes sense, nothing too scary there (except for that SPAM notification my email server added to the message).<\/p>\r\n<p>The body though, just isn&rsquo;t right. I have to think that if Facebook is sending me email messages, they&rsquo;ll take the time to:<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Make sure it looks professional. I&rsquo;m pretty sure the Facebook logo will be in anything they send to me.<\/li>\r\n<li>Address it to me. They know my first and last name, any message from my bank, amazon.com, facebook.com, linkedin.com and others better be addressed to me by name otherwise I&rsquo;m ignoring it. Why would they say &lsquo;Dear Facebook user&rsquo; when they could just have easily have said &lsquo;Dear John&rsquo;?<\/li>\r\n<li>Make sure it&rsquo;s in English. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but &lsquo;Accounts that do not submit the updated account agreement by the deadline will have restricted.&rsquo; Isn&rsquo;t a complete sentence and was probably written by someone who doesn&rsquo;t use English as a first language.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Now, here&rsquo;s where it gets interesting. So Facebook is a very popular, Internet-based Social Networking site, right? Everything (and I do mean everything) they do is done online, right? So, why would they send me a zipped attachment containing an account agreement? Nope, they&rsquo;d never do that. Take that a step further and ask yourself, not only would they not send me an attachment, they also wouldn&rsquo;t ask me to launch an executable to access the agreement. If, by the wildest stretch of the imagination, Facebook did send me an account agreeement as an attachment, woudn&rsquo;t you think the the attachment would be a text file, a Adobe Acrobat file (.pdf) or even a Microsoft Word document (.rtf, .doc or .docx)? It&rsquo;s an absolutely rediculous premise that people would think it&rsquo;s OK to unzip and attachment and execute an executable (I know, redundant) to access an account agreement for the world&rsquo;s biggest Internet site? &nbsp;Seriously?<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, I think it&rsquo;s funny that these spammers and scammers are still trying this approach. But, as I said at the beginning, they only reason this would still be happening is if either the scammers are really, really stupid or people are actually following the instructions and launching the attached executable. It has to be the latter and that just scares me.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2009-11-08 11:00:00","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2009-11-08 11:00:00","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"3","ordering":"129","metakey":"Facebook, Internet Scam","metadesc":"A description of another internet scam I received today","access":"1","hits":"8030","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

It does, it really does &ndash; but were being made to believe none of those things are important because of the way all of these apps are being made.

I expected RIM to use the Viigo application again like they did last year, but instead I found that they apparently engaged someone else to build this year&rsquo;s conference application. It&rsquo;s too bad, because the Viigo application is pretty cool and has usefulness outside of the conference and this new conference application is pretty horrible. The application is however a great example of how you should NOT build Java applications for BlackBerry devices. Let me explain&hellip;<\/p>\r\n<p>The application is installed from the BlackBerry App World which is cool and is what I would expect from any mainstream BlackBerry application released in 2009 and beyond. It&rsquo;s when you go into the application that you notice that the people who developed the application really didn&rsquo;t know what they were doing. The application wasn&rsquo;t crafted for a mobile user to use at the conference; it was crafted to show off the cool capabilities they have built into the application.<\/p>\r\n<p>When you first launch the application, a splash screen fades in (showing the conference logo), sits there for a while, then fades out again. If I&rsquo;m an attendee at the conference and I&rsquo;m trying to look up something (like where I need to be next) this long delay in opening the application just to show me how you can make a cool fade-in effect is a waste of my precious time and places an extra drain on the battery. Think about it, I&rsquo;m at a conference going from session to session sending emails, making phone calls and generally using my device heavily. On top of that, with the expected 1,000 people at the conference, it&rsquo;s likely that cellular wireless network coverage is going to be in high demand. I don&rsquo;t know if you knew this, but the BlackBerry device (and most smartphones) drain their battery at a more rapid pace when it has difficulty getting or keeping a wireless network connection. So, as I&rsquo;m sitting at the conference draining my battery at a higher rate because of an overloaded local network, the application is shamelessly wasting even more battery life. Now, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, wi-fi should be available, so I&rsquo;m not worried about data traffic &ndash; but when the voice network gets congested (as I expect it will) batteries start to drain.<\/p>\r\n<p>OK, when the splash screen finally fades away and I can get into the application I&rsquo;m presented with the screen you see below. They&rsquo;ve selected a VERY busy background and used these battery wasting scroll-in effects for the menu so it takes even longer before I can begin working in the application.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/devcon app1.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><br \/><br \/>As you scroll from menu item to menu item, the application uses this smooth fade-in ad fade-out for the selected menu item then changes the entire background image (as shown in the following figure).<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/><img src=\"images\/stories\/devcon app2.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>OK, so not only do I have a very busy (too busy) background image for the application, I have to wait as the application applies fancy effects to the menu and swaps out the complete background for the application. Yet another waste of my time and a huge waste of device battery life.&nbsp; Developers should not add screen effects that slow down application performance for the user. If you can implement them without affecting the user, great &ndash; otherwise leave them out of your application.<\/p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m an older guy and my eyesight has been deteriorating lately (not too bad, but enough to be annoying) and the dark menu against the busy background makes it very hard for me to be able to read the screen without my glasses on. Developers should always pay attention to how the background affects readability and usability for the application. Complicated or busy background images just don&rsquo;t belong in any mobile application.<\/p>\r\n<p>Notice by the way that in the pop-up menu (the menu you get when you press the BlackBerry menu key) the option for &lsquo;Configuration&rsquo; is misspelled. I&rsquo;m assuming this is because the application was created by one or more developers for whom English is not their primary language. Any time you build an application that will be consumed by others, you have to make sure you spell check all of the menus, field labels, help pages and content.<\/p>\r\n<p>For the first couple of times I tried to select anything, I went past the menu item I wanted because it was so unresponsive. When you&rsquo;re finally able to get to the menu item you want (I&rsquo;m serious, it&rsquo;s very, very slow on my BlackBerry Curve 8900) and you&rsquo;re looking at content, the developer did not follow RIM&rsquo;s standards for BlackBerry applications. Let me give some examples:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>When reading content, some of the standard navigation keys seem to work (such as &lsquo;t&rsquo; for top and &lsquo;b&rsquo; for bottom) but you cannot press the space bar to page through content. So, experienced BlackBerry users, ones who know how to quickly get to the content they want, won&rsquo;t be able to use standards they already use in other applications.<\/li>\r\n<li>The BlackBerry menu button is disabled in all of the content screens (about, event listings and more). So, if you are used to switching applications using the menu, you&rsquo;re out of luck. If you want to select some of the content to paste into another application, you&rsquo;re out of luck. If you want to invoke some third party menu item (like the screen shot capabilities of BoxTone Expert) you&rsquo;re out of luck.<br \/>Developers should ALWAYS build their BlackBerry applications so they work like every other BlackBerry application or at least all of the applications that come with the BlackBerry. Omitting standard features like keyboard shortcuts and the BlackBerry menu is a serious crime when it comes to BlackBerry applications.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><br \/>When looking at the about screen, the developer used some sort of special library to make the content scroll very smoothly. I&rsquo;m sorry, but that&rsquo;s just not needed &ndash; the BlackBerry platform provides a field you can use to display content and the BlackBerry device manages scrolling the content for you (including I believe allowing you to use the space bar to page through the content). Adding addition capabilities to an application that are already provided by the core platform is a waste of memory, processing time and battery life. There&rsquo;s no need for special stuff like this, all it does it make it take longer for me to be able to page through the content (it&rsquo;s so busy making the scrolling smooth that it&rsquo;s slower than it would be otherwise).<\/p>\r\n<p>When you look at the content on screens, the developer did not make any effort to match the application&rsquo;s fonts to how I have the device configured. As I mentioned earlier, I&rsquo;m a little older and I need a larger font. I&rsquo;ve set the BlackBerry screen options to display text in a size that allows me to read it without digging out my reading glasses. In this application, the developer has selected the font size and I find it very hard to read. If I go to the Configurations (that should be Configuration, but they forgot to check spelling) screen, there&rsquo;s no option for setting the display font. Developers building applications should pay attention to what settings the user has for Screen and Display options and act accordingly. Deciding for me what screen font size to use would work for many users, but for those of us who don&rsquo;t wear glasses all the time but need help, the application is all but unusable.<\/p>\r\n<p>Take a look at the application&rsquo;s configuration screen; I don&rsquo;t understand why developers feel the need to build special screen elements for configuration screens. This one is just like the main screen, a slow and unresponsive menu system that doesn&rsquo;t add any value. Why not just make a simple screen with the appropriate fields? Why take up the extra memory for all of these extra features? Why kill the battery life by forcing the user to go through all of these custom menu and field animations when the ability to have normal, everyday fields is built into the platform?&nbsp; In later versions of the BlackBerry Device Software, RIM added the background factory which allows developers to easily place a screen or field background in their applications &ndash; there&rsquo;s no need for all of this extra junk &ndash; it adds no value for the end user, all it does is allow the developer to show off and it&rsquo;s just wasting my time (and battery performance).<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/devcon app4.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><br \/><br \/>The developer of the application is Sweet Caesar Inc (http:\/\/www.sweetcaesar.com\/) &ndash; I&rsquo;d suggest that they spend a little more time making their application usable and less time making it pretty. There are going to be 1,000 people in San Francisco this week cursing their product every single time they use it. Not a good thing for a company&rsquo;s reputation.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"2","created":"2009-11-09 16:43:39","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2009-11-09 16:43:39","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"7","ordering":"40","metakey":"BlackBerry Developer Conference, BlackBerry Java Development","metadesc":"An analysis of the BlackBerry Development Conference application from Sweet Caesar - in an effort to illustrate how NOT to build a BlackBerry Java application.","access":"1","hits":"17340","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

{"id":"106","asset_id":"141","title":"Another Internet Scam (on Amazon.com)","alias":"another-internet-scam-on-amazoncom","introtext":"<p>As you may or may not know, BlackBerry Development Fundamentals was not actually my first book. If you’re reading this from my Amazon Author page, then it’s easy to see that.<\/p>\r\n<p>I was a Soccer (Football for those who know better) Official for about half of my life and on the day I retired and I left my last Referee meeting (it ended up being my next to last meeting, but that’s another story I’ll probably not share) I decided to write a book for brand new Soccer referees. I’d been a Referee Instructor, worked Professional matches (both Indoor and Outdoor) and travelled all across the US working games so I thought I had a lot of good insights to share.<\/p>\r\n<p>I know of many people who ‘decide’ to write a book but never do, but in this case, I promised myself that I’d actually write the book – and I did! I discussed it with my wife, spent some nights and a week of vacation and finished it. It actually took longer to lay it out in Adobe Framemaker and go through many review cycles than it did to write it.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, I wrote it and it’s published - it's called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1419682334?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mcnsof-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1419682334\">What Now?: The Essential Guide for New Soccer Referees<\/a><img src=\"http:\/\/www.assoc-amazon.com\/e\/ir?t=mcnsof-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1419682334\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" \/>. It’s available on amazon.com and not many people have actually purchased it (although it is a great book if I do say myself). It’s targeted at brand new Soccer Referees – the ones who walk out of their first Referee clinic with glazed eyes and ask themselves ‘What now?’ The clinics are so chock full of information and there’s so much to know, that new referees leave and just don’t know what to do next. The book specifically covers that – starting the minute the clinic ends and taking you through to the beginning of your second game. I thought it was a pretty cool idea and many people who have read it have agreed.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, the reason I’m writing about the book here is because of this sort of scam going on at amazon.com that I just can’t figure out. The book’s on sale on amazon.com through a subsidiary called Book Surge. It’s publish on demand, so when you place an order for the book, they dig up the source file, print and bind a copy of the book, stuff it in an envelope (with an amazon.com label of course) and plunk it in the mail. Sounds pretty simple, doesn’t it?<\/p>\r\n<p>So here’s where the scam comes in – and I have to be honest and say that I really don’t understand it. Here it goes…<\/p>\r\n<p>You can buy the book brand new and in perfect shape (Perfect Bound even – it’s an industry term) for $14.95US. Seems pretty straight forward. Now, when you go to my book’s page here, you’ll see that there are vendors selling both new and used copies of the book. Take a look:<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/><img src=\"images\/stories\/what now on amazon.jpg\" alt=\"What Now? On Amazon.Com\" title=\"What Now? On Amazon.Com\" class=\"caption\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Now, what I don’t understand is why there are vendors out there selling the book for twice and even almost 3 times the standard price of the book? If you can get the book for $14.95, why would you buy it at $35.00 or more? It just doesn’t make sense. Now, if I was famous (I’m not) or if it was a special copy of the book (signed for example, which I know they aren’t – I know I haven’t signed any), it could be worth more money, but not what these places are charging.<\/p>\r\n<p>Why would there ever be a market for the book at those prices? It’s not really selling at $14.95, why would ANYONE think it would sell at an even higher price?<\/p>\r\n<p>The reason I called this a scam is because it just seems like one. There has to be some angle – nobody would actually buy one of the books, so the vendors must be doing it so it looks to buyers that they have a large inventory. There’s clearly something weird going on though and I’m pretty sure that Amazon should do something about it. It’s not fair to consumers to allow products to be offered at such a ridiculous price.<\/p>\r\n<p>Do you think the vendor is just going to buy a copy of the book for $14.95 then turn around and send it to the sucker who paid them double list price? I don’t see it happening. Do you think they actually have a used copy of the book? I did send about 60 out to every US State Director of Referee Instruction (and never heard back from any of them), it’s possible that one of more of them sold it or donated it to a reseller – but why a minimum of twice list price? That’s still not making sense – are people really that stupid?&nbsp; “hey, look here – I can get a USED copy for only twice what a new one would cost!”<\/p>\r\n<p>I sent one of the vendors an inquiry – asking “Why do you think that people will pay more than double the list price for a used copy of my book? It doesn't make sense.” I’ll let you know what I hear back although I doubt I’ll hear anything. In the mean time, if you’re going to buy my book, please buy a new one, it will cost you a whole lot less money. If you want a signed copy, please let me know and I’ll sign it and mail it to you for list price plus shipping (still less than these vendors are selling them for). Hopefully Amazon will see this and do some research – it shouldn’t be allowed to do this.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2009-11-24 12:00:00","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2009-11-24 12:00:00","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"6","ordering":"127","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"9719","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

{"id":"116","asset_id":"151","title":"Review of Beginning BlackBerry Development by Anthony Rizk","alias":"review-of-beginning-blackberry-development-by-anthony-rizk","introtext":"<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/beginning blackbery development 120.png\" align=\"left\" \/>On my flights home from the 2009 BlackBerry Developer Conference in San Francisco I had a chance to read Anthony Rizk’s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1430272252?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mcnsof-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1430272252\">Beginning BlackBerry Development<\/a><img src=\"http:\/\/www.assoc-amazon.com\/e\/ir?t=mcnsof-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1430272252\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" \/>. I wasn’t one of the lucky folks who received a free copy of the book at the conference – I’d received it in advance of the event and brought it with me to read on the plane home. Anthony did sign it for me at the conference, so that was fun. When I discovered that the book was on its way, I contacted Anthony to find out about his book and see how it compared to mine. It turns out that they’re very complimentary – they both address beginning developers, but cover different parts of the topic.<\/p>\r\n<p>The book is really good – I enjoyed reading it and learned some things I’ve always wanted to know. First of all, although the title doesn’t say this, the book is a Java book – targeted at BlackBerry developers who want to get started writing Java applications for the BlackBerry platform. It doesn’t cover anything about web development and only covers the platform (BES and MDS) very lightly. You should already be comfortable with Java development; the book doesn’t cover any of the basics, only the BlackBerry specific stuff you’ll need to know to work on the platform. It’s a rather short book, only about 240 pages, so don’t expect it to cover any particular topic in great detail.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anthony wrote the book in short lessons, each tackling a different part of the whole picture. The book begins with defining a little about the platform, how to obtain and install the development tools (chapter 1) then how to build a simple Hello World application (required for any beginning development book) and test\/debug it in the simulator and on an actual device (chapter 2). Next he digs into what makes a BlackBerry Java application and some specific features\/requirements of the platform (chapter 3). In all, it’s a great introduction to BlackBerry Java development.<\/p>\r\n<p>Once you’re beyond the basics, the book starts building a sample application that illustrates how to build an application’s user interface (chapters 4 and 5). What he does is work you through building a login screen for a sample application then extending it to leverage some features of the platform and also how to tweak and tune the UI components Research In Motion provides to make the application look and feel like you want. While much of the chapters cover topics most Java developers will already know, he addresses the BlackBerry-specific stuff you’ll need to understand related to working with the Research In Motion UI Libraries.<\/p>\r\n<p>The next couple of chapters dig into some both standard and unique capabilities of the BlackBerry platform: Storing data (chapter 6), Network Connections (chapter 7) and location based services (chapter 8). For each of these, the BlackBerry platform supports industry standards\/specifications (RMS for data storage, HTTP connections for network access and JSR 179 for location based services) but also has some special enhancements or supports additional options to allow you to create more robust applications. These topics aren’t covered in tremendous detail, but you leave each chapter knowing exactly what you need to know to begin using these capabilities in your BlackBerry Java applications.<\/p>\r\n<p>Chapter 9 digs into how to package up your application for deployment (through Desktop Manager deployment, BES Push, OTA Pull or through BlackBerry App World).<\/p>\r\n<p>Anthony has been a BlackBerry Java developer for a long time, so he really knows what he’s doing and it shows in the book. His writing style is very comfortable and he covers each topic not deeply but well. The book is structured in a way to make it easy to digest each topic before moving on to the next, so as long as you know Java, you should be all ready to go after reading it.<\/p>\r\n<p>The book’s got some typos and errors, but if you’re an experienced developer you won’t have any trouble spotting them and making the necessary adjustments. It’s clear that they rushed the book out to get it released in time for the BlackBerry Developer Conference, so it’s understandable. Anthony told me he’s building a list of these items and will hopefully get them implemented in the next printing.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you’re a Java developer and want a quick primer to get you started on the BlackBerry Java platform, this book is for you.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you’ve been a BlackBerry Java developer for some time, the book may have information you don’t already have, but that’s unlikely. If you’re expecting this to be a heavy duty, deep dive into BlackBerry Java development, you’ll be disappointed (but the title should have warned you away anyway). There’s still no reason you shouldn’t purchase a copy and keep it around to lend to those pesky developers who keep asking you simple questions.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"2","created":"2009-12-02 01:54:13","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2009-12-02 01:54:13","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"8","ordering":"38","metakey":"Beginning BlackBerry Development, BlackBerry Java Development.","metadesc":"Review of Beginning BlackBerry Development by Anthony Rizk","access":"1","hits":"8715","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

It’s designed to highlight the trips and tricks of building Domino browser based application for mobile phones and smartphones. There’s so many things web developers need to worry about when working with mobile devices – we’re going to try to lay it all out for people who attend the session.<\/p>\r\n<p>Rob and I have been working on the outline for the session and it’s really beginning to come together. I’ve known Rob for a long time and he and I both have interesting perspectives to bring to the session. We’re having some interesting discussions about some common misconceptions and things that need to be taken into account when building mobile web applications.<\/p>\r\n<p>Here's a link to the session abstract:<\/p>\r\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www-950.ibm.com\/events\/wwe\/lotus\/lsph2010.nsf\/sessionabstract?openform&amp;sessionid=BP212\">https:\/\/www-950.ibm.com\/events\/wwe\/lotus\/lsph2010.nsf\/sessionabstract?openform&amp;sessionid=BP212<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p>The other session I’m doing is called ‘<em>Beyond the Mobile Browser – Building Rich Mobile Applications for Domino.<\/em>’ It’s really an extension of the first session. In this one, I’m going to demonstrate how to build several mobile rich client applications that talk to a Domino Database. The assumption here is that although the browser is cool and all – that sometimes the browser isn’t sufficient for your application. Perhaps the user needs to manipulate data while disconnected from the network (on a plane for example or when in a business location without wireless coverage) or integrate with other applications on the device (such as the contacts, tasks or messages application). This session is an new and improved version of a session I did at the View Domino Administrator\/Developer Conference in Boston earlier this year. I’m going to be building a rich client in Java (for the BlackBerry platform), Windows Mobile and probably Android. I’d like to do iPhone, but I don’t have a Macintosh and just don’t have the relevant skills right now.<\/p>\r\n<p>Here's a link to the session abstract:<\/p>\r\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www-950.ibm.com\/events\/wwe\/lotus\/lsph2010.nsf\/sessionabstract?openform&amp;sessionid=AD114\">https:\/\/www-950.ibm.com\/events\/wwe\/lotus\/lsph2010.nsf\/sessionabstract?openform&amp;sessionid=AD114<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, both sessions should be high energy, very interesting sessions. Please plan on attending if you’re at Lotusphere.

{"id":"123","asset_id":"158","title":"What were they thinking...","alias":"wwtt1","introtext":"<p>For our Lotusphere presentation in January, Rob Wunderlich and I started talking about how to approach our topic about mobile web development. One of the things that came up was an agreement that a lot of developers, while they know all about web development, didn't think of the ramifications of their decisions as they mobilized their sites. Even though the mobile browser supports most of the web development standards, it doesn't mean you should make use of them. Also, even though you know how to build a site for a desktop browser, doesn't mean you should do the same thing for the mobile user.<\/p>\r\n<p>We decided then that the underlying theme for our session was going to be 'What were they thinking' and in preparation for that I have started collecting examples of bad (bad, very bad) things that mobile developers do that makes life hard for mobile users. As I collect these things, I'll start posting them to the site and see where I can take this.<\/p>\r\n<p>The first example for this series is is shown below. I am at a hotel attending some sales training (yep, I'm a sales guy now) provided by my employer and tried to connect to the hotel's wireless network to do some work. My BlackBerry Storm 9700 was smart enough to recognize that I was on a hotspot network, so immediately launched the hotspot browser so I could login to the access point before going on to do my work. When I looked at the page, I noticed something that I thought I'd share with you as the first rule in the 'what were they thinking' series.<\/p>\r\n<p>Take a look at the following image:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/screenshot-dec0809-123242p.jpg\" alt=\"iBAHN Login Page\" title=\"iBAHN Login Page\" class=\"caption\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>The site gave me an easy way to select my language that didn't consume too much screen real estate (always a good thing). Imagine how much harder it would have been to use if there was a big list of languages or a drop-down list containing the list of supported languages?<\/p>\r\n<p>Where the developer went wrong was in the way he (or she) used the radio button. Whenever you present a radio button to a mobile user and there's only one item in the list, you make them do extra work to select that tiny little button before clicking next. The smart developer will detect how many items there are in the list and either remove the choice all together or, if you're going to put a single item in a radio button list, pre-select the only available option. Don't make the user make the selection if there's no possible other option for them to use. It just doesn't make sense to make the user do that extra work when it's not necessary.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>I'm a little older and I'm starting to have trouble reading mobile device screens without my glasses, so when I was first presented with this page I immediately clicked the next button and didn't think about the radio button.Of course the page errored out and I had to go back and pay close attention to what I was doing - but this wasn't a good use of my time.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you're building a site like this, please think about the impact of these types of things on your user. There's no reason to force a selection when there's really nothing to select.&nbsp; Make sense?&nbsp; Implementing this in dynamic environments like PHP or Domino is really, really simple - just a simple if statement with two different HTML outputs depending on the number of options in the list.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"14","created":"2009-12-09 11:21:19","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2009-12-09 11:21:19","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"7","ordering":"96","metakey":"mobile web development","metadesc":"The beginning of a series of articles where I talk about things developers do that make web pages hard to use by mobile users","access":"1","hits":"7769","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

Just on a whim, I navigated over to linkedin.com to see how their site looked on the BlackBerry Browser. I expected that they'd detect that I'm running a BlackBerry and give me a mobile version of their site, but I was wrong - take a look at the following screen shot:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/screenshot-dec0909-024858p.jpg\" alt=\"LinkedIn web site on the BlackBerry Browser\" title=\"LinkedIn web site on the BlackBerry Browser\" class=\"caption\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>The LinkedIn developers broke the first rule of Mobile Web Development: Always (and yes, I do mean always) Detect the Browser!<\/p>\r\n<p>What were they thinking? I cover this in the book, but it's important to highlight something here.&nbsp; Because of the iPhone and other smartphones, developers are building their sites disregarding the information available to them about the target device. The iPhone and the Storm for example have pretty large screens, so 'normal' sites render on them OK, so developers have gotten lazy and just assume everyone's a desktop browser and tosses out the page. Unfortunately, even though the modern smartphone can render pages designed for the desktop (because of their supports for desktop browser standards and the larger screen than earlier smartphones) it doesn't always make sense to do that. Big web pages on small screens just don't look right (see the figure) and it's disrespectful of mobile users to send a whole bunch of gunk to the browser (graphics and a bunch of menu items).<\/p>\r\n<p>Mobile web sites must be designed with the mobile user in mind and crafted so the user can get as quickly as possible to the data that matters to them. In this case, LinkedIn doesn't seem to be sensing that I'm accessing their site from a BlackBerry and gave me their standard page. Developers must always detect the user-agent and send a text-only, designed for small screen page to mobile devices.<\/p>\r\n<p>On the BlackBerry and other mobile platforms, the user has the choice of changing the browser's personality to IE or Firefox.Let the user make this configuration change then get the whole page when they have the browser impersonating a desktop browser. Then, when people like me who let the BlackBerry announce itself as a BlackBerry, send a mobile-friendly version to all mobile devices.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"14","created":"2009-12-10 11:29:39","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2009-12-10 11:29:39","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"4","ordering":"95","metakey":"Detect the browser. mobile browser","metadesc":"Mobile developers should always detect the HTTP User-Agent and deliver mobile friendly versions of pages to mobile devices.","access":"1","hits":"7794","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"125","asset_id":"160","title":"What Were They Thinking #3","alias":"wwtt3","introtext":"<p>This example of 'What Were They Thinking' is for a Java application, not a web application - but I thought it would be an interesting addition to the series. It refers to something that absolutely drives me crazy in BlackBerry Java applications and I've seen the same kind of thing on other mobile platforms as well. Here we go...<\/p>\r\n<p>As i've mentioned before, I'm getting older and with my advanced age comes reduced eyesight. If you see in the sample screen shot below, my BlackBerry client is configured to use pretty large fonts:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/screenshot-dec0909-104528a.jpg\" alt=\"My BlackBerry Messages Application\" title=\"My BlackBerry Messages Application\" class=\"caption\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>This approach makes it easy for me to read the screen without my reading glasses (which I've not yet gotten around to keeping with me always). I know this takes up more screen space, but it's something I just have to do.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now, last week I was working in RIM's Chalk application (Chalk is a recent purchase and allows organizations to easily push rich content to devices). When I opened the application's main screen, here's what I saw:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/screenshot-dec0809-063122p.jpg\" alt=\"BlackBerry Chalk Application Screen\" title=\"BlackBerry Chalk Application Screen\" class=\"caption\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>The developer (or developers) who built this application, selected a font and size to be used for the application without paying any attention to how I had my particular device configured. For me, it's completely unusable without my glasses.<\/p>\r\n<p>Why do developers disregard the user when desiging their applications? The BlackBerry device provides me with the means to configure the screen using any font and font size I want, but I have to deal with applications that completely ignore that. I know they've done this so they can give their application cool effects (like the graphical background you see in the figure) but that just doesn't take the needs of the actual user into account. I know any 20's user can see this easly, but it just doesn't work for us that are in our 40's.<\/p>\r\n<p>Mobile developers - when building rich client applications on mobile devices, query the system to determine the font and font size selected by the device user and use that to craft any and all of your application screens. It's unreasonable to do otherwise. Trust that the device user knows better than you do how he or she wants text displayed on the device's small screen.<\/p>\r\n<p>I'll try to scare up a sample application that does this (on the BlackBerry of course) so you can see how it works.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"14","created":"2009-12-13 19:23:46","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2009-12-13 19:23:46","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"6","ordering":"94","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"7177","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

{"id":"131","asset_id":"164","title":"What Were They Thinking #4","alias":"wwtt4","introtext":"<p>My company recently asked us to install and use an application on our BlackBerry devices and as soon as I saw the application icon, I knew I had another topic for my 'What were they thinking' series.&nbsp; Please take a look at the following BlackBerry screen shot:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/app icon example.jpg\" alt=\"Misfit Application Icon\" title=\"Misfit Application Icon\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>If you take a look at the last icon in the first row, you should be able to easily tell that it just doesn't match the look of all of the other icons on the device's home screen. When working with the Apple iPhone or Windows Mobile devices, there isn't really any adherence to any theme when it comes to application icons. On the BlackBerry platform on the other hand, the icons on the home screen are designed specifically to look similar to all of the other icons in the theme - mostly because it's a theme and that's how themes work.<\/p>\r\n<p>When building application icons for BlackBerry devices, it's a good idea to make sure your application icon matches the 'theme' of the default theme for the particular device. I know this means more work for the developer, but if you don't do this, you end up with screens like the one shown above.<\/p>\r\n<p>The reason this is a problem for me is that, because of the way the developer designed the application icon, every time I looked at the device, it looked to me like the bright orange icon shown in the figure was the currently highlighted icon. Every time I looked at it, I immediately assumed that was the one highlighted and tried to move it off of that icon to the application I'd intended to open. Every time (and I promise you it happened many, many times), the 'Profiles' application or my 'Messages' application was actually the selected icon and I felt like an idiot. You shouldn't use icons that contrast so starkly with the other icons on the device - the selected icon should be unique, but at the same time should blend in with the rest of the theme.<\/p>\r\n<p>In this case, I'm sure it wasn't that the developer wasn't thinking. What really happened I bet was that the icon was the last thing added to the application right before it was released and the developer just threw something together so he or she could finish the project and move on to the next one. Considering the orange color and globe icon are synonymous with my employer, it's easy to see how that was what was selected in this case. Also, this application was created using one of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/iAnywhere\/2008-dec-gartner-mq-meap-sy-slides\">MEAP<\/a> tools (I won't say which one) and therefore had to run across multiple platforms, so it's likely that's why a theme appropriate icon was not selected for this application. If it were me, I'd have made sure that the icon was less...standoutish (like a sore thumb).<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"14","created":"2009-12-17 01:08:32","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2009-12-17 01:08:32","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"4","ordering":"93","metakey":"BlackBerry application icon, MEAP","metadesc":"Developers should pay close attention to the default theme for BlackBerry devices when selecting an application icon.","access":"1","hits":"7919","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"132","asset_id":"165","title":"Internet Scam 20091207","alias":"internet-scam-20091207","introtext":"<p>I received another really interesting email the other day and I thought I’d write about it in my continuing series on Internet Scams. I got an email supposedly from American Express as shown in the following figure:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/internet scam 20091207 blurred.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>The thing about it though was I knew that American Express didn’t have this email address. My ISP flagged it as Spam, always a useful aid and there were a lot of other things about the message that confirmed that it was just another scam.<\/p>\r\n<p>In my Outlook inbox I used <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.qurb.com\/\">Qurb<\/a> (now called ‘CA Anti-Spam Plus’) which makes sure that no messages make it into my inbox unless I have them in my contact list, I’ve written to that address or manually approved the address previously. That makes it easy to spot Spam since all suspect messages are siphoned off into a special folder that I can peruse later to free up messages from new, approved senders. Thunderbird on the other hand doesn’t have (that I know of) a whitelisting Spam filter, so I have to drill through my Spam manually. Fortunately it does support the identification of Junk senders and uses <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bayesian_probability\">Bayesian Probability<\/a> to identify Spam based upon the messages I’ve marked as Spam previously. Here's an article from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.wired.com\/wired\/archive\/8.02\/autonomy_pr.html\">Wired Magazine <\/a>where I first heard of this technology.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, as I read through the email I saw a lot of things that assured me that this was spam. For the screen shot I turned on message headers - which provide me with a whole bunch of additional information about the source of the message. I blurred some if the information in the screen shot to help protect my ISP’s servers.<\/p>\r\n<p>Let’s go through the list:<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Message Subject: Not likely that American Express is going to send me a message about an ‘American Express Online Form.’ There couldn’t possibly be anything like that I’d need to address.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol><ol>\r\n<li>American Express would always address me by name, not using ‘Dear American Express Customer.’<\/li>\r\n<li>Message Body: It just doesn’t make sense. <\/li>\r\n<li>Logo: There’s no American Express logo in the email anywhere. The scammer sent an HTML format email message rather than plain text, so you’d think since it’s already HTML that a logo file would be displayed (further luring me into believing that the message actually came from American Express).<\/li>\r\n<li>To Address: The message was sent to ‘info@mdecorporation.com’ which isn’t where it was delivered (it was delivered to info@mcnellysoftworks.com). That’s a sure sign that it’s Spam!<\/li>\r\n<li>Received Address: From looking at the message headers, it’s clear that the message thinks it was received from an account at The University of Texas at El Paso (utep.edu). Ya, I’m pretty sure American Express is not going to send me a message from a University computer system\/account.<\/li>\r\n<li>Return-Path: The headers show that the return address is set to an email account in Russia. I’m pretty sure American Express isn’t going to be sending me email messages from Russia.<\/li>\r\n<li>X-Mailer: The headers show that the message was sent by Microsoft Outlook Express 6.00.2900.2180. I’m pretty sure American Express is not going to be sending me email messages from Outlook Express.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol><ol> <\/ol>That’s all I have for this one.

{"id":"136","asset_id":"168","title":"My Problem with Foobar","alias":"my-problem-with-foobar","introtext":"<p>I read a lot of computer books and application development books – you’d have to expect that considering what I do for a living. Recently I’ve been catching up on some of my Joomla! books and of course reading the BlackBerry development books that followed mine and there’s something that always bothers me in these types of books and I thought I’d rant about it a little bit…<\/p>\r\n<p>In most development books, the authors always use ‘foo’, ‘bar’ and\/or ‘foobar’ as sample function names in their sample code. What I can never tell is whether the person using those terms understands what they’re doing or whether someone did it once and everyone else just followed.<\/p>\r\n<p>Let me give you some background:<\/p>\r\n<p>A very long time ago (who knows how far back – Wikipedia says it was in 1944) some army grunt used the term ‘FUBAR’ to describe something that was ‘mucked up beyond all recognition’ or ‘mucked up beyond all repair’ (depending on which version of the story you hear) substituting an ‘F’ for the ‘M’ in mucked of course. The term was apparently very widely used in the US army (or so my father told me from his experiences in the Korean War).<\/p>\r\n<p>What I can’t figure out is how the term got mangled into something that’s used so often in computer books. The term is clearly not something that you’d expect to people to use in a book, so I guess that’s how it became foobar instead of FUBAR. Probably mostly because it would be too easy to mispronounce ‘fu’ as perhaps fuh instead of foo – so that’s why ‘they’ made it ‘foo’? Anyway, why is this being used? I’m not offended by the term, but it is a crude and impolite word to use in a regular, every day book.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you read the Wikipedia reference for FUBAR http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fubar and foobar http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Foobar, the writers there have clearly tried to pretend that the words are not related (confusingly the FUBAR page says they’re not related: ‘Not to be confused with foobar’ but the foobar page mentions that foobar may actually be related to FUBAR). How could they not be referring to the same word? Some developer geek heard about the expression and started using it in his sample code and before we know it, it’s being used everywhere. Why can’t the sample function names be something like ‘function1’ &amp; ‘function2’ or ‘somefunction’ &amp; ‘anotherfunction’ instead of ‘foo’ and ‘bar’? It just doesn’t make sense to me.<\/p>\r\n<p>The reason this all came to mind I guess was that many people use words like this without really knowing what they’re saying. I purchased much of the furniture in my house from a family run furniture company in Amish country (although they were not an Amish family – just craftsmen living in Amish country). I was speaking to the owner’s wife about a misconnection on a delivery to my house when she said “I’m so sorry about the SNAFU.” I was completely taken by surprise by her comment – she was after all a quiet, polite lady in her late 50’s or early 60’s. I laughed for a minute then asked her if she knew what SNAFU meant. When she said that she didn’t, I told her that that expression was another Army term standing for ‘Situation Normal, All Mucked Up’ (or course again substituting an ‘F’ for the ‘M’ in mucked). She was shocked and stunned and quickly promised “I’ll never use that term again!”<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, feel free to disagree with me, but I’m certain the initial use of foobar in computer sample code was a sort of trick played by some geek a long time ago and we’re stuck with it in every new computer book that comes out. I wish people would drop it – again, it’s not that I’m offended by it, I just think it’s stupid to have that expression (although a slightly modified one) used in professionally produced books. I wish the editors would all get together and ban that term from all code examples in computer books going forward. I promise that you won’t find the expression in BlackBerry Development Fundamentals and in any other book I write!<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2009-12-28 13:00:00","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2009-12-28 13:00:00","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"2","ordering":"114","metakey":"FUBAR, SNAFU, foobar","metadesc":"an analysis of fubar and foobar and why foobar is even used in computer books","access":"1","hits":"7223","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

Wild times this holiday season I can tell ya. On top of that I contracted H1N1 and Pneumonia - I can't tell you how much fun that was.<\/p>\r\n<p>One of the things we've been talking about is whether we're going to order landline(s) for the new house. My wife and I both have mobile phones of course and our kids don't get phone calls but by the time they do, they'll probably have their own mobile numbers. I've always argued with my wife about having wired phones in the house (I'm OK with cordless phones, but wanted at least one wired phone in case of a power outage). I won that argument after a huge winter storm knocked out power for a few days and she was able to call people because I had the necessary wired phones available to her. It's always fun to be right....<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, since I work for AT&amp;T now and get pretty good pricing on phone lines, I decided that even though the trend was to go completely wireless rather than installing landlines that I'd get one anyway (actually three - home, home office and one for McNelly SoftWorks) just because it would be very convenient. The house we purchased is 11 years old, so it still hase RJ-11 jacks everywhere. Not sure that would be the case in any new house I purchase\/build in the next couple of years. So, for this house we're installing landlines expecting that not to be the case for the next one.<\/p>\r\n<p>I was looking through the press the other day and found the following article: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.fiercebroadbandwireless.com\/story\/t-wants-fccs-blessing-shut-down-pstn\/2010-01-03?utm_medium=nl&amp;utm_source=internal\">AT&amp;T wants the FCC's blessing to shut down PSTN<\/a> which indicates that AT&amp;T (the number one provider of Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) in the United States) has begun lobbying the FCC to allow it to shut down the landline telephone service. It makes sense, everyone nowadays is using their mobile phone as their primary phone numbers; any kid coming out of college will have one number and will never install a landline in any apartment or house. It won't be very long before landlines become more and more expensive because less and less people are using them. What does it mean for businesses?<\/p>\r\n<p>Even though consumers aren't using landline phones anymore - how does a business have a phone number if AT&amp;T is shutting down the analog Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)? Of course everything switches to the broadband netywork. We'll all be using VOIP I expect and companies and old guys like me will be getting their POTS line through my high-speed broadband connection running into the house. I expect service will be the same, but it will require more hardware I expect and an ever bigger load on the broadband connection.<\/p>\r\n<p>I expect it would relieve a huge burden if AT&amp;T didn't have to maintain both PSTN and broadband networks. Getting rid of the analog network would allow them to dedicate much more money toward providing better broadband and wireless service.

With their building the Android platform, buying up of all that dark fiber, building data centers along river banks (for cooling and power generation) in the Dakotas and building those shipping container data centers they were supposed to put at the Internet's major access points - I was sure they were going to set themselves up to compete with the existing carriers and force a change in the way the US wireless carriers did business.<\/p>\r\n<p>What I imagined was Google setting themselves up as a wireless provider using the 700 MHz spectrum I was sure they were going to buy then offering essentially free devices in return for the ability to run local ads across a dedicated portion of the device screen. Anyone would be able to walk into a Best Buy or WalMart, plunk down $50 or $100 and have essentially a device with free wireless network access. When they pulled out of the auction I wasn't quite sure what they were all about and I'm still not sure.<\/p>\r\n<p>When all of that press generated a few weeks ago about the proposed Nexus One device - a mobile device Google would sell direct - I was certain it was all bunk. That they just wouldn't try to go direct like that. Well, Google made the announcement today: http:\/\/www.pcmag.com\/article2\/0,2817,2357687,00.asp. With this new device, people will be able to plunk down the full price for the device and get an unlocked device they can use on any compitable network (just like I believe you can in Europe and other parts of the world). Once I walked into a carrier sales center with a device I already owned and only had to pay a monthly fee for service (no contract) I promised myself that I'd never do anything but purchase the device at full price and use any carrier I wanted. Now Google is making it so it's very easy for me to do this. No begging your carrier to allow you to unlock it - just buy an unlocked phone directly from the manufacturer and do whatever you want with it.<\/p>\r\n<p>It's going to be very interesting to see what impact this is going to have on the US Wireless Carrier market.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"15","created":"2010-01-06 13:00:00","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2010-01-06 13:00:00","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"3","ordering":"33","metakey":"Google Nexus One, google, Google Android","metadesc":"Google Nexus One","access":"1","hits":"8323","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

They probably think that 3G is better than 2G and 4G will be better than 3G, but they probably just don’t know why.

As soon as the carriers upgrade to the new 4G (faster than 3G) networks, more and more smartphones and more and more network unaware applications will fill those networks too. As the processing speeds and capabilities increase on these smartphones, all they’ll do is use even more bandwidth and there’s likely no way the carriers can keep up (just my humble, personal opinion).<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"15","created":"2010-01-18 17:11:19","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2010-01-18 17:11:19","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"2","ordering":"31","metakey":"3G, AT&T, Verizon","metadesc":"What is 3G?","access":"1","hits":"8667","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

{"id":"147","asset_id":"179","title":"Battery Bit","alias":"battery-bit","introtext":"<p>I’m going to try to coin a new phrase this afternoon in my Browser Development tricks session at Lotusphere 2010. I wanted to write about it here first, just in case it takes off and I get credit for the idea <img border=\"0\" src=\"plugins\/editors\/jce\/tiny_mce\/plugins\/emotions\/img\/smiley-wink.gif\" alt=\"Wink\" title=\"Wink\" \/>. The term is \"Battery Bit\" or, as I decided to try out early this morning, ‘Battery Bit Time.’ I’ll explain what it means in a little bit (no pun intended).<\/p>\r\n<p>I’ve been doing a lot of analysis of the wireless development space and have noticed a couple of trends. The biggest one is that developers have begun (mostly because of the iPhone) to completely disregard the network and the limited capabilities of mobile devices when they build their applications – especially their mobile web applications. We’re dealing with small devices with limited processing capacity, limited memory and limited battery life, and developers are regularly building apps that no longer take that into consideration. They’re treating these smartphones like they’re desktop computers and that’s causing problems for everyone.<\/p>\r\n<p>AT&amp;T is getting hammered by its customers and by the press for its network problems, but honestly (as an AT&amp;T employee it’s very important for me to point out here that the statements made in this post are my personal opinion and in no way reflect or represent the thoughts or opinions of my employer) it’s the users &amp; applications and their complete disregard for the network that are causing the problem.&nbsp; The network is fine – and recent independent tests have concluded that it’s faster and better than its competitors; it’s how the network is being used that’s creating all of the problems. I hope to get some time in the next couple of weeks to write more about this because I think I have some interesting insights into this – but we’ll see if I can carve out the time to do that writing…<\/p>\r\n<p>OK, now back to Battery Bit Time. As Mike Lazaridis (the founder of RIM) says, there’s no way to get around Physics. Every bit of data that is delivered to and processed by a mobile device has an impact on the device battery life, the wireless network and the application user. Let’s dig into this.<\/p>\r\n<p>Every single bit (or byte, depending on how you look at this) of data transmitted to and\/or from a mobile device affects the battery life for the device. If you send less data, you’ll likely get better battery life out of your device. It’s simple Physics (or as my father would say “it’s Basic Physics”), every amount of work the device is asked to perform drains the battery. There’s just no way around it. So, what happened to the days where mobile developers took that into account with their applications? It’s gone. The iPhone is basically a small desktop device – even its browser refuses to identify itself as a mobile browser. It’s regularly downloading full, desktop versions of web sites across a wireless network that shouldn’t be processing so much data. Developers should always (and yes, I do mean always) send as little data as needed across the wireless network to provide the needed functionality for the application. No more than needed. There’s no need for Flash, images, cool transitions or other glitz – just send the data the user needs and nothing else. Mobile web sites should be text-based, nothing more. If you do this Developers, you’ll allow your users, through the simple application of Physics, to achieve better (longer) battery life for their mobile devices. Since Apple has decided we’re not worthy of being able to swap out batteries (which all other mobile devices do) when we run out of power this becomes even more important for iPhone users.<\/p>\r\n<p>As with every bit of data transmitted to\/from a mobile device, every bit processed by the mobile device application (whether it be a browser or custom application) has an effect on the user. Every bit of work done by the processor further drains the battery. There’s no way around the Physics of this. It’s why as much processing as possible should be done by the back-end server, minimizing the work done by the client-side processor. When building mobile web sites or rich client applications, as cool as the technologies are that allow you to crunch data locally and create a very cool and compelling visual experience for your applications – it’s not needed on a mobile device and does nothing but drain the battery and decrease the responsiveness of the application for the user. See my article about the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=103:how-not-to-blackberry-java&amp;catid=2&amp;Itemid=4\">BlackBerry Developer Conference application <\/a>for more on this topic.<\/p>\r\n<p>Taking this even further, every bit of data transmitted to\/from a mobile device and every bit processed by the mobile device application increases the amount of time it takes to display the data on the screen for the user to access\/act upon. Mobile devices and mobile applications provide immediacy – give me access to the things I need access to when I need access to them. Right? By building these complicated applications – web applications with all this funky, dynamic rich content or native applications with all of these fancy visual effects and transitions does nothing but drain the battery, make the processor do more work and delays the display of the data the mobile user is interested in seeing.<\/p>\r\n<p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=103:how-not-to-blackberry-java&amp;catid=2&amp;Itemid=4\">BlackBerry Developer Conference application<\/a> drove me crazy because of how long it made me wait to see the data I wanted just because they wanted to have a custom screen background image for every page and a cool fade transition between menu item selections. It’s ridiculous. These are mobile devices with limited processing capability, limited battery capacity and limited network bandwidth available to it. Treat the mobile device it’s a mobile device – give the users access to the information or data they need and do nothing more. Just because you can do all of these fancy screens, transitions and so on doesn’t mean you should when you’re dealing with a mobile device. Those types of things are cool for desktop browsers where you have relatively unlimited processing power and much bulkier networks, but they just don’t belong on wireless apps.<\/p>\r\n<p>If needed, one of the things the BlackBerry does that no other platform does (that I know of) is set an HTTP Header called ‘Via’ that identifies to the target server what connection was used to request the data. Using this, a developer could determine that the connection was made over a Wi-Fi network connection (the Via header isn’t sent when connecting over a Wi-Fi connection) and send a richer version of a web site or an application's data when it knows it has a faster connection available to it. There’s still the problem with processing and rendering time, but it does give the developer more options.<\/p>\r\n<p>The wireless carriers are in the process of beefing up their networks (4G’s coming soon) but at the same time, mobile devices are getting bigger processors and more memory (not more battery life sadly). Did you see that LG announced a smartphone recently with a 1 GHz processor? Ginormous processing capacity – shouldn’t be used unless absolutely needed.<\/p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Battery Bit Time <\/strong>– The impact that the decisions Developers make have on mobile users and wireless network providers.&nbsp; More bits (either processed or delivered) affects battery life and the amount of time the user waits to see the data they want to see.<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>Even though we’ll soon have almost unlimited processing capacity and network bandwidth availability doesn’t mean that it should be used the way it’s being used.&nbsp; If developers start taking this into account and get back to building mobile applications for mobile devices (instead of building desktop applications for mobile devices), then all of us will be much happier. We’ll be able to use our devices for longer periods without recharging, we’ll think our applications are more responsive and easier to use, and we’ll probably stop complaining about our wireless network providers since there will now be more room for more users and more application data across their networks. <br \/>If you get a chance, swing by my session this afternoon, it’s in Swan 5-6 at 3:30 (I’d originally reported it was at 3:00 PM – that was an error).<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"14","created":"2010-01-19 10:26:12","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2010-01-19 10:26:12","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"8","ordering":"90","metakey":"Battery Bit, Battery Bit Time, Lotusphere, Browser Development, BlackBerry, iPhone","metadesc":"A description of a new term I created called Battery Bit Time.","access":"1","hits":"10095","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

I was using EditText and TextView widgets to create some of the UI. EditText widgets to accept user input and TextView widgets to display some text on the screen. When playing around with some things, I’d inadvertently cast the TextView as an EditText object (that happens some time when you’re copying and modifying code).

{"id":"163","asset_id":"193","title":"What Were They Thinking #5","alias":"what-were-they-thinking-5","introtext":"<p>As part of my family’s move to Charlotte, it was time to start looking for a new bank. We selected Bank Of America and proceeded to setup our new accounts. It occurred to me to take a look to see if the bank had an iPhone application and I was pleased to find that they did. I downloaded the application from the iTunes and proceeded to launch it. When the application starts, it presents you with the screen shown in the following figure.<\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/bofa_app1.jpg\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>You can then define your account login information (including the same additional security measures Bank of America uses on their desktop browser application) and access all of your accounts and transactions. It’s pretty cool and I like it. I’m not going to show you this with my own accounts (yes, I blanked out my login name in the figure below), but I’ll describe it. What you see after you login is a list of your accounts. When you select an account, you’re provided with a list of transactions and other information.<\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/bofa_app2.jpg\" \/><br \/>Figure 2<\/p>\r\n<p>The only complaint I have about the application is that it’s very sluggish – after you login and start navigating through the account information, the screen response is very slow. Whoever wrote the application apparently didn’t know how to optimize the menu items and so on to provide the best user experience.<\/p>\r\n<p>Where the What Were They Thinking stuff begins is when you look at the BlackBerry version of the application.<\/p>\r\n<p>I didn’t expect that there’d be a BlackBerry version of the app. It wasn’t until I’d used the iPhone version for a while that I thought to look in the BlackBerry AppWorld for the app. Surprise of surprises – Bank of America also offers a BlackBerry application. So many times, vendors decide that all people care about is the iPhone application and skip other platforms. In this case, they are trying to accommodate multiple platforms. The problem is that they didn’t implement the same features in the BlackBerry version of the application.<\/p>\r\n<p>When you open the BlackBerry version of the app, you see the screen shown below.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/> <img src=\"images\/stories\/bofa_app3.jpg\" \/><br \/>Figure 3<\/p>\r\n<p>It looks like the same features of the iPhone application. When you open the ‘Locations Near Me’ option, the application uses the GPS information available on the device to determine the location of the nearest bank locations – very nice.<br \/>When you click on ‘Mobile Banking Sign In’ you’d think it will prompt you for your credentials and allow you to view account information (just like the iPhone app). Nope, that’s not how it works here. When you select this option, you’re presented with the following screen.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/> <img src=\"images\/stories\/bofa_app4.jpg\" \/><br \/>Figure 4<\/p>\r\n<p>What???? The Browser? What were they thinking? The iPhone application shows an interactive list of accounts then allows you to browse the account transactions inside of a native iPhone application. The BlackBerry application launches the browser and gives you the exact same functionality you’d get if you fired up the browser and typed in www.bankofamerica.com in the address bar. The browser???<\/p>\r\n<p>Eventually you get to the login prompt and you just have to deal with the mobile browser version of the site.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/> <img src=\"images\/stories\/bofa_app5.jpg\" \/><br \/>Figure 5<\/p>\r\n<p>What’s the point? It’s essentially useless except for the branch finder. I just don’t know what they were thinking. The bank spent the time and money to build a fully functional iPhone app but relegated BlackBerry users to a simple application that merely launches a particular URL in the BlackBerry browser.<\/p>\r\n<p>Developers: Please don’t do this. The functionality the application needs to call on the back end to get the account information and account activity clearly exists (the iPhone application is using it) and the BlackBerry platform supports the exact same application capabilities that the iPhone does (the same API’s are generally available across both platforms) so why the dfifference? I bet it was harder to do for the BlackBerry and it will take them some time to deliver parity. I’m OK with that – UI’s are just easier to build on the newer platforms (iPhone, Android).&nbsp; But the BlackBerry can call any service on the back end and process the data – just like the iPhone app. If it’s too hard to build the long list of account transactions like used in the iPhone application, just have the server return the activity as HTML and render it in a BrowserField in the BlackBerry version. You’d still get the same data and you can make it look like the iPhone application (although on non-touchscreen BlackBerry devices it won’t be as easy to navigate. You could always intercept the click within the browser field and open up the selected account activity record natively.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, my personal opinion is that hybrid applications for the BlackBerry should be avoided at all times. If you need to launch the&nbsp; browser to provide your application with specific functionality then you’re not really trying to build a BlackBerry app – all you’re building is a shell program that uses the browser for its heavy lifting and I’m really not interested in using that kind of application.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"14","created":"2010-02-04 13:43:05","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2010-02-04 13:43:05","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"8","ordering":"86","metakey":"Bank of America, BlackBerry, iPhone","metadesc":"Analysis of the Bank of America BlackBerry application.","access":"1","hits":"8632","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

Then there's budget.  Making an application for one platform and then having to write it again for another is a big disincentive to do so.

It just doesn't work. After trying FatCow's automated install several times (which worked, but Sugar wouldn't run after the installation completed) and many manual installations of SugarCRM 5.5 (the latest version) I decided to give FatCow support a call. FatCow's usually awesome and sine they're giving me so much for very little money, I try not to call them too often.<\/p>\r\n<p>I spoke with a tech who told me what I was asking for was more complicated than he could handle (I like honesty) he immediately escalated me and I spoke with a guy (Jordan I think was his name) who understood my problem and got to work. He immediately tried their automated install - it failed with the exact same errors I was getting (validation, I love it). Then he downloaded the latest community version files (free) from the Internet and did the installation himself - it failed again (even more validation that my error was reproducable). He opened a ticket and promised to escalate it to Engineering.<\/p>\r\n<p>I waited a couple of days and received several emails from FatCow as they tried to work through my problem. Of course, some of the messages I got were related to the technicians just not reading the case history (I hate that and FatCow does it all the time - phone support is AWESOME, but dealing with online support is HORRIBLE for that reason alone). They finally told me that were able to get it installed and operational. Unfortunately they installed an old version (4.4, I'm trying to use 5.5), they installed it in a location different than where I asked to have it installed and they REFUSE (yep, absolutely and repeatedly refuse) to tell me anything except that they have it installed. I've asked what they did to get it to work - won't tell me. I've told them that I need 5.5 to work, not 4.4 and the only response I get is 'SugarCRM works on our systems' - nothing else. Arghhhhhh!&nbsp; These guys are usually so good but in this case, they're absolutely refusing to actually help me with my problem.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now, I know FatCow doesn't 'support' SugarCRM, but they'll install it for me and it's just PHP, MYSQL and some other stuff - it should work just fine, right? Every single other product I've tried to install on their systems work just great (Joomla!, Drupal, vBulletin, phpBB and more).<\/p>\r\n<p>I've been working with the folks on the SugarCRM forums for help and finally got a chance tonight to look at one response where another customer is having difficulty with SugarCRM on FatCow (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.sugarcrm.com\/forums\/showthread.php?t=56281\">http:\/\/www.sugarcrm.com\/forums\/showthread.php?t=56281<\/a>). So now I know it's not just me having troubles. I'm stil lnot getting anywhere with FatCow support - for the 10th time now I've said 'please, why won't you answer my questions' - I'm going to call tomorrow and see if I can get a manager on the phone or speak with my original tech since they are clearly demonstrating that they're not interested in helping me.<\/p>\r\n<p>Their service is so awesome for a very reasonable amount of money that I hate to complain. The issue though is that I'd gladly pay more money per year (I already have two accounts just so I can give them more money - I'm serious) to get the help I need but they just don't seem to care.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2010-02-08 01:42:28","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2010-02-08 01:42:28","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"8","ordering":"117","metakey":"SugarCRM, FatCow","metadesc":"The pain I've endured trying to get FatCow to support the installation of the community edition of SugarCRM.","access":"1","hits":"7362","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

{"id":"175","asset_id":"205","title":"Apple Doesn't Care About the Network","alias":"apple-doesnt-care-about-the-network","introtext":"<p>I was at a meeting before Christmas and someone from Apple was presenting on the application development capabilities of the iPhone platform. What was interesting from the session was that Apple was touting all of these developer-related features that really didn't differ from the capabilities of the other major mobile platforms. For everything that he mentioned (with one exception) I could point to the exact same capability being available on the BlackBerry and other platforms. I'm not sure what was going on here - I guess he assumed he wasn't talking to a Developer audience (he really wasn't) and could get away with it.<\/p>\r\n<p>The one exception? Background applications. Yep, most other platforms do it (heck, the Palm platform finally does) but the iPhone doesn't. I finally figured out why Apple doesn't allow background applications on the iPhone - I hope I get time to write about it soon. No, it's not for the reasons they say. I was really, really surprised that the guy could explain away the prohibition against background applications with a straight face, but he did. I guess he earned his pay that day.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, back to the purpose for this post. Apple really doesn't care about the mobile network. As you'll see in a post I'm writing for posting (hopefully) tomorrow, it's in Apple's best interest to have the most compelling application platform (they do). What they want is everyone developing for the iPhone and being upset because the same applications (I'm talking about the web here) just don't work well on other platforms (they don't). They want to be the leaders in the mobile application space (they are) and really don't care how they do it.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, during this session with Apple, they explained that there's this cool new application you can download from the App Store that allows you to stream video from one iPhone to another. WHAT??? They're promoting device to device streaming video? Imagine being at your kid's school play and streaming the show to your spouse who couldn't make it? Wow, that's cool - but think about the network! The iPhone is already killing AT&amp;T's network and now they're deploying an application that allows even more saturation of the network? Yep, that's it - they really don't care about the network. Someone in the audience raised his hand and asked about the impact this would have on an already saturated network and the guy from Apple rolled his eyes, placed his hands behind his back <em>and refused to answer<\/em>. He just stood there for a little while until someone asked another question. Is that amazing or what?<\/p>\r\n<p>Implementing any features that makes better (read 'reduced') use of the network would reduce performance for the user and therefore impact the user's overall experience with the platform. Users would get snappier applications, increased battery life and would ultimately be able to do more with their devices, but that's not 'cool' or market leading. Carriers would get less complaints about the network and more users would be able to get more done at the same time, but it only affects one Wireless Carrier in the US so how bad could that be?<\/p>\r\n<p>The best thing that could happen to AT&amp;T and iPhone users would be for other US Wireless Carriers to get the iPhone as well. When all Wireless Carriers and users are being affected by this disregard for the network I bet we'd see the market force some changes on Apple to make the iPhone (and soon the iPad) play nice with others.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Disclaimer: Recognizing that I work for AT&amp;T, the content in this article is my personal opinion only and does not reflect the opinion or public voice of AT&amp;T.<\/em><\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"15","created":"2010-03-02 02:35:06","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2010-03-02 02:35:06","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"10","ordering":"30","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"10844","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

Developers are starting to revolt (look at what the developer of the Facebook application for the iPhone did a few months ago: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2009\/11\/11\/joe-hewitt-developer-of-facebooks-massively-popular-iphone-app-quits-the-project\/\">here<\/a>) and the market is going to turn away from the iPhone platform. This is going to happen only because of Apple's policies and in spite of the fact that it's a very cool, sexy and capable device.<\/p>\r\n<p>The breadth of things you can do with the iPhone are being limited by the vendor, not by any limitations of the device.

{"id":"180","asset_id":"210","title":"The iPhone In the Enterprise","alias":"iphone-in-the-enterprise","introtext":"<p> <\/p>\r\n<p>A colleague asked me a while back to provide my comments on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.infoworld.com\/iphone-deep-dive\">InfoWorld’s Enterprise iPhone Deep Dive Report<\/a>. I found it to be an interesting read and I was convinced when I finished that you should never allow a bigot to write an article if you’re going to pretend that you’re impartial.<br \/><br \/>I could be wrong on this, and as usual my comments below do not reflect the official position of AT&amp;T, but here’s my take on the report:<br \/><br \/>I’m not sure the iPhone is capable of satisfying the enterprise and the different articles in the report highlight many of the issues, but not really the root cause behind them.&nbsp; Apple historically has never really ‘understood’ the enterprise and until now it hasn’t really been an issue. Now that these organizations have all of these remote devices accessing corporate data, it’s even more important that Apple understand the enterprise.&nbsp; Buried deep within the report was the following statement: <br \/><br \/><\/p>\r\n<blockquote>“Apple designed the iPhone as a consumer device, so it’s heavy on convenience and light on security. If you want protection, you have to accept some pain”<br \/><\/blockquote>\r\n<p><br \/>No enterprise is going to be interested in hearing that unless they’re willing to forgo security in order to have the cool device (which is currently the case with many enterprises). <br \/><br \/>If you think about the platform, it was designed under the premise that users would not run any application other than the applications provided by Apple or a select few of very trusted partners. The web browser, being a desktop browser in a small package rather than an actual mobile browser, was deemed to be sufficient for all user needs. The tradeoff they got by making this assumption was that they could build the platform allowing all applications to run with root level access within the Unix security model. They wouldn’t need a security model since they weren’t planning on allowing anything but their applications to run. All applications run with the same level of access and each and every application can do anything it wants to anything else on the device. No sandboxing, no varying levels of access (Apple applications running with the most access, other applications running with less), nothing. Everything runs as root. No system administrator on any unix system in the world would allow that for any end user computing device, but that’s what Apple did with the iPhone. <br \/><br \/>After Apple decided that end-users did want to have access to applications, Apple quickly ‘patched’ the environment to allow third-party applications. They took a system designed with no security and added a security model (of sorts) on top of it. Now, third party applications could be created and Apple reserved access to some API’s for itself – most likely over security or performance concerns. What I believe, unless Apple has done a complete rewrite, is that the iPhone platform doesn’t have the foundation enterprises need to feel that the device is secure in their environments. <br \/><br \/>I believe that Apple’s prohibition of background applications is another offshoot of this design. Since they didn’t build the necessary security restrictions in the original platform, they have to worry about applications running in the background, gaining access to all sorts of information and data the enterprise would otherwise not want accessed. By not allowing background applications, they can avoid any security concerns over inter-process communication. <br \/><br \/>Apple’s getting there with regards to support for ActiveSync policies. More and more policies will be added over time. What’s clear from the article is that if you’re on ActiveSync, many of the enterprise security features you need are there and I believe more and more will continue to appear with each release of the platform.&nbsp; If you’re not on ActiveSync, then your choices for enterprise management are:<\/p>\r\n<p>1. Buy a third party product<br \/>2. Use the free tool Apple offers, the iPhone Configuration Utility<\/p>\r\n<p>The problem with the iPhone Configuration Utility is that while you have the ability to configure all sorts of settings, there’s absolutely no way to ensure that these settings are deployed and correctly maintained on the affected mobile devices. None. The user has to act to implement the security feature you have created for them. Enterprises security departments will not accept that as an option. The report later says:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<blockquote>“But a big IT issue remains: you can’t easily manage iPhones through a central console wirelessly, even though you can do some management (profiles and remote wipe) via email, the web and\/or Exchange 2007. IT Pros rightfully complain that Apple essentially forces them to use a local PC as a management workstation and physically connect user’s iPhones to it”<br \/><\/blockquote>\r\n<br \/>The conclusion correctly reached in the report is that ActiveSync good, anything else bad. Since the majority of enterprises are running Exchange, most organizations should be OK. &nbsp;<br \/><br \/>There’s still the issue where any iPhone prior to the 3GS would report to ActiveSync that it was capable of encrypting or was actually encrypting the local data when it actually lacked the capability it said it had. That’s got to have many enterprises scared to death and I’m waiting to see what lawsuits make it into the courts over that one. Take for example the Massachusetts law that goes into effect in March requiring any organization to encrypt data regarding any Massachusetts resident any time it’s stored:<br \/><br \/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.27001.com\/massachusetts-data-protection-law.aspx\">http:\/\/www.27001.com\/massachusetts-data-protection-law.aspx<\/a><br \/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.mass.gov\/Eoca\/docs\/idtheft\/201CMR17faqs.pdf\">http:\/\/www.mass.gov\/Eoca\/docs\/idtheft\/201CMR17faqs.pdf<\/a><br \/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/searchsecurity.techtarget.com\/news\/article\/0,289142,sid14_gci1347836,00.html\">http:\/\/searchsecurity.techtarget.com\/news\/article\/0,289142,sid14_gci1347836,00.html#<\/a><br \/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.alertboot.com\/blog\/blogs\/endpoint_security\/archive\/2009\/01\/06\/massachusetts-data-encryption-law-201-cmr-17-00.aspx\">http:\/\/www.alertboot.com\/blog\/blogs\/endpoint_security\/archive\/2009\/01\/06\/massachusetts-data-encryption-law-201-cmr-17-00.aspx<\/a><br \/><br \/>In the case of the iPhone, enterprises would believe it’s encrypted and they’re in compliance with the law when on older iPhones it won’t be the case even though the device is saying it is. Not good for enterprises.<br \/><br \/>I learned a little from some other topics in the report. I’ve always wondered why Apple forces everyone to go through them for application approval. I always thought that developers should be able to do whatever they want on the platform. That won’t work for Apple. Since the fundamental security platform isn’t there, Apple has to analyze and approve all applications because they have to make sure that the application isn’t doing anything it’s not supposed to be doing. What was most telling was Apple’s prohibition of downloading any code from the internet. Apple even forced one vendor to remove the eval function from their JavaScript library.&nbsp; This is because a developer could download dangerous code and execute it within the context of the application – without the needed security model, Apple can’t allow it. The BlackBerry and Android platforms can both allow this ‘feature’ because the requisite security features needed to protect the user and\/or enterprise were built into the platform from the very beginning. <br \/><br \/>The last thing I noticed was that several of the articles were laced with inaccuracies. It’s clear that the authors are enamored with the iPhone platform and didn’t take the time to validate the things they said about the other platforms. I was able to update the author that indicated that the BlackBerry platform supported WebKit in newer devices (not true) but the iPhone vs. BlackBerry article was chock full of falsehoods and it’s clear that the author didn’t care about being accurate.","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"15","created":"2010-03-10 01:30:46","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2010-03-10 01:30:46","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"5","ordering":"28","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"8557","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

I had a horrible time with some of my demo's, everything crashed but I was still able to show everything (because every good presenter has a back-up copy of everything ready to show).<\/p>\r\n<p>For this year's View conference, I've finished the Android version of the application (it's pretty cool and I learned an awful lot about Android in the process) so I'll be showing that along with the BlackBerry application. I was thinking of also showing the Windows Mobile application again, but I'm just not sure people really care about it. With the forthcoming Windows Mobile 7 breaking every previous version of the application, the Jury's out as to whether I should still show it. Let me know what you think. Even though the slide decks are due today, I'm planning on spending the rest of the time between now and the conference building the same application for the iPhone. I'm going to first do the development using XCode and Objective-C but hopefully I'll have time to build a browser-based application as well using DashCode. We'll see what happens and how much time I have to throw at this.<\/p>\r\n<p>As I promised after Lotusphere, I will be publishing an article about how to build the Android application here (with source code).<\/p>\r\n<p>I'm also doing a session entitled \"Current Trends in Mobile Application Development\" where I'll be talking about the current trends in mobile application development ;-).<\/p>\r\n<p>I've also taken a position as a Technical Advisor to The View publication.

Considering that they invented the whole smartphone market, they’re usually pretty good about designing BlackBerry applications with forethought and an attention to detail. After all, they created the platform and they’re responsible for maintaining consistency across all applications. Right?<\/p>\r\n<p>I was browsing through the list of free applications in the BlackBerry App World application yesterday and was struck with how hard it was to read the application names in the list of free applications. See the figure below for an example of what I saw:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/appworld.jpg\" \/><br \/> <br \/>When building a mobile application, you have to pay special attention to first of all how much data is delivered across the wireless network and how much work the application has to do to process and render the data. This is wireless application 101 stuff.<\/p>\r\n<p>When you look at the application list, you’ll notice that they’ve designed the application so you can see the application’s icon (useful for branding purposes) but only a portion of the application’s title. I don’t know about you, but I can’t tell what the application names are for these applications.<\/p>\r\n<p>On top of that, take a look at how much screen space is taken up by the word ‘Free’ for each application. We already know it’s a list of free applications – if we didn’t remember that when we looked at the screen, we could have easily been reminded by looking at the ‘Top Free’ in the title bar. There’s no need to show the word ‘Free’ for each application – they’re all free. It’s extra screen space that could have been used to allow more of the application name to display.<\/p>\r\n<p>Since I can’t read the full application name, I have to open each application to learn what the app name is – bad use of my time. There’s also absolutely no reason why the application title can’t wrap around to the next line.&nbsp; Who cares if it takes up an extra line on the display? If you look closely at the screenshot, you’ll see that there’s wasted space anyway underneath the application vendor name. They didn’t try to scale the application icon to the available space used by the application title and vendor – what they should have done was kept the icon the same size and adjust the font sizes to allow three lines of text for the application title and vendor.<\/p>\r\n<p>Which is more important, making it easy for the user of the application to be able to read the information on the screen or keeping all rows the same height? I’m hoping you will agree with me that the user is more important here.

If you look at the figure, you'll see that I'm clearly going blind (just kidding, just having trouble reading things) and have the font on my BlackBerry device cranked up high. The reader was right, the problem I was complaining about was my fault, but I contend that it still never should have happened. Here's my take on this:<\/p>\r\n<p>First of all, since I'm looking at a listing of free apps, there's no need to list 'Free' for every item in the list. They're all free, there's no need to take up the screen space (and processing time to render) content that is not needed. Do you agree that highlighing the 'freeness' of a free application that's clearly already fee is a waste?<\/p>\r\n<p>Second, although I agree that the issue I'm reporting is related to my personal font settings, it is the responsibility of the developer to detect the size of the fonts being used and adjust rendering on the screen accordingly. The developer of the application should have detected the font size (they alread did since we can see they used my font settings to render the screen) and make sure everything fits correctly using that font. There's no reason he or she couldn't have seen that the text as written was not going to fit into the allocated space (using the settings I've defined) and wrap the text on the screen so me, the user, would be able to read the entire application name. This is something I had to do in my <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.officialsrecordkeeper.com\">Official's Record Keeper<\/a> application in all of the reports. For any text I wanted to write to the report canvas, I had to check it's width and wrap it manually in the code. It's a pain in the you know what, but it's something that should have been addressed by the developer and I stand by my complaint. <img src=\"plugins\/editors\/jce\/tiny_mce\/plugins\/emotions\/img\/smiley-smile.gif\" alt=\"Smile\" title=\"Smile\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Look at all of the extra, unused space created by the height of the application logo. They clearly had the room to extend the row to accommodate the wrapped application title. I'd rather have the extra space under the icon than under the text block - especially since I can't read the entire application title as it is.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"14","created":"2010-03-26 22:20:39","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2010-03-26 22:20:39","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"4","ordering":"83","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"7393","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

I ordered one as soon as I could pre-order and had to wait an extra couple of days to get my hands on the device because I inadvertently had it shipped to my old address and was out of town on the 3rd. It finally arrived on Monday and I've been amazed with it ever since.<\/p>\r\n<p>It's a truly amazing device and feels great in your hands. I've started downloading a bunch of news applications (I really want to be able to keep up with my local and world news on it – no more paper newspapers) and some fun drawing tools for the kids. What amazes me the most is the weather applications that are available for it. Considering the weather we've had here in North Carolina tonight (tornado watches and warnings) my wife and I have been sitting with it watching the radar maps and local weather report videos.<\/p>\r\n<p>It truly is going to be a game changing device – I'm convinced that it's going to completely change the way people interact with computers. I found TweetDeck for it and I'm waiting for the FaceBook application to become available for it. I've found that the web browsing experience is really great – the browsing I've done and the surveys and form data entry I've done has been very comfortable.<\/p>\r\n<p>I have been experiencing some pretty poor Wi-Fi connectivity issues. It was comforting to hear that others are having the same problem and that Apple has responded. My Wi-Fi access point is in one end of my house and I can't access the network on my iPad from the other side of the house. Even 25 or 30 feet away I'm really not getting the throughput that I should be getting. I'm going to wait semi-patiently to see what Apple does about the problem. This is the first Apple computing product I've purchased since my old Apple \/\/e (with 1 MB of memory mind you) and I still believe they make amazing products (although I remain unimpressed with Steve Job's (er, I mean Apple's) attitude about iPhone applications). My employer has provided me with an iPhone and recently a MacBook (so I can do some iPhone development) and I'm having a lot of fun playing with the products. I'm still a BlackBerry user day to day, but the iPhone is great for applications. When the new OS becomes available and I can finally run background applications I'm sure I'll begin using my iPhone more frequently. Unfortunately Research In Motion really doesn't seem to be trying to stay in the sexiness game and it saddens me.<\/p>\r\n<p>I am having a problem with the iPad Book Reader application. I've purchased some books (I even found a free Isaac Azimov book from Project Gutenberg) and I spent a recent road trip reading on the iPad. I've found it to be a very nice experience. The Book Reader application though has some formatting problems that I thought I'd point out.<\/p>\r\n<p>When the book reader displays an italicized word next to a regular word, it scrunches up the space to the left of the italicized word so it looks like it's right next to the preceding word (no space between the words) as shown in the following figure.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/ipad ebook reader 1.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>For those readers of my What Were They Thinking series, the problem I'm having isn't related to the font size I have set on the device – rest assured that I'm running it at the default font settings for the device.<\/p>\r\n<p>Additionally, when the reader uses small caps to render a person's title, I'm having the same problem – the words are all scrunched up as shown below:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/ipad ebook reader 2.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2<\/p>\r\n<p>Another thing I noticed is that when the Reader displays an Initial Caps for the first letter in a paragraph that it inserts some extra space between that line and the line that follows. It's not like it needs the extra space, it just adds it unnecessarily.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/ipad ebook reader 3.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 3<\/p>\r\n<p>I'm going to keep watching to see if others are experiencing the same problem and whether Apple takes the time to fix it soon.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"15","created":"2010-04-09 23:41:30","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2010-04-09 23:41:30","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"5","ordering":"27","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"9131","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

{"id":"188","asset_id":"218","title":"Multitasking iPhone","alias":"multitasking-iphone","introtext":"<p>The big announcement this week came from Apple who finally announced background processing for the iPhone and iPad. Here's a snippet from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.pcmag.com\/article2\/0,2817,2362406,00.asp\">an article in PC Magazine<\/a>:<\/p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Within multitasking, Jobs also highlighted several capabilities, acknowledging that the company had been outpaced by other mobile operating systems with multitasking capabilities, just as other companies passed them in adding cut-and-paste capabilities. \"We weren't first to this party, but we're going to be the best,\" Jobs said.<\/p>\r\n<p>If a user wants to shift to another app, he or she can double tap the \"home\" button. A \"dock\" with recent applications will appear, allowing the user to shift to another application. Apps that aren't being used become \"quiescent,\" and the OS saves their state and pulls resources from them. When the OS shifts back, those resources are re-allocated, and the user has a chance to resume where he or she left off, Jobs said.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"In multitasking, if you see a task manager, you blew it,\" Jobs said.<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<p>For me though, I'm still amazed at Apple's attitude toward its customers.<\/p>\r\n<p>'Outpaced by other mobile operating systems'? Apple wasn't 'outpaced' by other operating systems with their ability to cut &amp; copy text or run applications in the background - those are standard features that most every smartphone owner expects from their device and Apple decided for some bizarre reason not to include the features.&nbsp; I just don't get it.&nbsp; The only smartphone I can think of that didn't allow background apps was the Palm OS and I was surprised it lasted so long without the ability. Copy &amp; Paste? The only smartphone that I can think of that didn't allow that was the original Motorola Q. Those features are minimum requirements for any OS and for Apple to pretend that they were outsmarted by their competitors is a joke.<\/p>\r\n<p>Regarding Multitasking - how is Apple thinking double-clicking a button and bringing up a list of 'docked' applications to select from isn't a task manager? That button was designed to be clicked once to activate the device or take you back to the home screen - it's a pretty hefty push to activate it and people won't be good at double-clicking it. They've clearly tried for force fit this feature (when it should have been baked in from the very beginning).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>It's not even true multitasking - notice how the article references that applications that are pushed to the background are suspended? They're not running, their used memory is stored and retrieved later when the application is reactivated. I'm sorry, but that's not multitasking. I understand how a mobile platform would want to have the ability to suspend background tasks when memory is low, but applications should be able to run in the background and only give up their memory when needed.<\/p>\r\n<p>Imagine a user who's about to beging a time consuming task. He starts the task then switches to another application to do something productive while the original application is doing its stuff. In this scenario the user expects the application to continue with its processing, but according to the description of the 'feature' that's not what will happen.<\/p>\r\n<p>The iPhone and the iPad are amazing devices, but I'm still continually stunned by Apple's analysis of the market and what it thinks its users will accept as reasonable. Of course, I'v ebeen having some serious arguments lateley with some friends of mine and one of them contends that Apple is catering to people who don't care about these features and that they'll just take whatever Apple gives them.

{"id":"190","asset_id":"219","title":"What Were They Thinking #7","alias":"what-were-they-thinking-7","introtext":"<p>Apparently March 18th was a big day for updates to applications in the BlackBerry App World. As the screen shot below shows, my device inbox was all of a sudden filled with notices of applications that needed to be upgraded.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/app world updates 1.jpg\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Nice, I like that the system notifies me and I can tell quickly which applications need updates. When I opened the App World application, one of the things I quickly noticed was that App World didn’t have the means to update all of the applications simultaneously. Instead, I was presented with a list like the one shown in the following screen shot.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/app world updates 2.jpg\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Rather than give me an easy option to update all of the applications, I had to select each application individually and start the update for each manually. Granted the developers of the application didn’t expect so many updates on the same day, but they probably should have.<br \/>This is one of the things I like about the Apple App Store, when there are a bunch of updates, you can click the ‘Update all’ button and all of the affected applications are updated.<\/p>\r\n<p>This is a hard one – you don’t want to code for every possible options for an application, but pick the ones that you think will happen most often (and cover other cases later). But the App World application has been updated several times and if the number of applications was expected to grow (as it has) then the developers should have made accommodation for the case where multiple applications have updates simultaneously.<\/p>\r\n<p>I’m currently working as a project manager for an application for a major retailer and one of the things that came up this week is related to this. The application is calling a web service to retrieve a list of items from a list the user has created. The Web Service the application is calling supports a calling method that returns all list items, but also supports an option that allows you to specify a starting point in the list and the number of rows returned to the calling function.&nbsp; The developer of the iPhone application called the operation using the default option (all items) and during testing the customer found that the application quickly crashed. Of course, the developer only tested with short lists and the customer’s QA department tested with huge lists. Both teams tested with unreasonable size lists and of course we had problems.<\/p>\r\n<p>In this simple case, the developer, having seen that the back-end web service supported two calling methods, should have coded the application to accommodate very long lists in its original implementation. That way, the application would work with reasonable lists (10 to 20 items) but would also work when the list exceeded the original expectation. I know it’s more work, but that’s the way it should have been developed from the beginning. As it is, we’re already a little late for release of the application and the developer is trying to submit a change order for the new work to implement the system in a way that should have been done this way all along.<\/p>\r\n<p>For those of you who are Domino developers – look at how IBM managed the default behavior when rendering a view in the browser – the default behavior (and the expected behavior) is when the view is short, display all documents. When the list is long, render the view in pages and allow the users to page between chunks of documents until they find the one they want. Another smart thing they did was make the default number of view rows that are displayed a configuration value on the server, but also something that could be easily overridden in the ?OpenView URL.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"14","created":"2010-04-16 00:36:23","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2010-04-16 00:36:23","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"3","ordering":"82","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"6825","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

For this year’s conference I wanted to spice things up a little bit and add Android and possibly iPhone examples of the same application to my session.<\/p>\r\n<p>The thing about Android and iPhone is that unlike BlackBerry and Windows Mobile, the platforms do not have native support for consuming Web Services. So, in order to be able to work with Domino from Android or iPhone you have to find another way to do it. What I did for those sample applications was rewrite the code for the service into a Domino agent that returned JavaScript Object Notation (JSON – www.json.org) when called through a web URL. It didn’t take me that long to do and it works very well, so I have what I need to work with the other mobile platforms. So, in the next few weeks, I’m going to publish an article that describes the JSON-based web service.<\/p>\r\n<p>I wasn’t able to get the Android example done in time for Lotusphere (not without trying, I killed a lot of nights in Orlando during the conference furiously trying to get the app done – god thing I was recovering from pneumonia and didn’t want to party anyway). A while after Lotusphere I finally got the application done, so I’m going to cover that application at the View conference in a few weeks. After the conference (perhaps before if I get time) I’m going to publish an article that illustrates how to build an Android application that talks to the JSON-based web service. Just so you believe that it works, here’s a screen shot of the application.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/android-app.png\" title=\"Android Contact Lookup Application\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>I’m most of the way through building the same application for the iPhone. It’s been a nightmare building the application – Objective-C is so weird and complicated that I’m really struggling to finish the last part of the application. I’m planning to finish the application in time for the conference, I think I can do it, but like I said, I’m struggling. I’m probably not going to publish anything here about the iPhone application – I’m going to see if I can get an article about the application published in the View. Stay tuned on that one. Just to whet your appetite here’s a screen shot of the application.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/screen shot 2010-04-19 at 8.06.06 am.png\" title=\"iPhone Contact Lookup Application\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"14","created":"2010-04-23 01:03:43","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2010-04-23 01:03:43","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"5","ordering":"81","metakey":"Domino Web Service, Android, Google Android, RESTFul, JSON","metadesc":"I will soon be writing an extension to my series of articles about how to access a Domino database from a mobile device.

There haven’t been a lot of big announcements, but some of merit.<\/p>\r\n<p>RIM announced two new phones on Monday – the BlackBerry Pearl refresh (the 9100) which is supposed to be slated for release by AT&amp;T but not really announced by the carrier. The BlackBerry Bold is making its way to CDMA carriers (Verizon Wireless in the US) with the new BlackBerry 9650.<\/p>\r\n<p>They also announced BlackBerry Mobile Voice System (MVS) 5.0 which now adds support for Wi-Fi calling (VOIP) through MVS.&nbsp; I had an MVS account when I worked at Research In Motion and it was pretty cool. It’s an interesting concept and great to have your desk phone ring on your BlackBerry.<\/p>\r\n<p>During the opening session, Research In Motion showed a video that highlighted the features and capabilities of BlackBerry Device Software 6.0. Research In Motion’s been getting so much pressure in the market to update their UI to match that found on the iPhone and Android platforms and looks like they’re set to deliver. I truly can’t wait to get my hands on the new device software (It’s not the OS although that’s what many people call it – the BlackBerry OS is running at different versions numbers, it’s the BlackBerry Device Software that the user interacts with) to see what’s new. Apparently Research In Motion has done a complete UI refresh on all of the applications. The BlackBerry messages application is already VERY capable for my email use (I just can’t stand the mail client on the iPhone) and I can only imagine this will be even better. It looked from the video Research In Motion showed that it’s got a lot of cool new features.<\/p>\r\n<p>There’s a lot of speculation that Research In Motion’s got plans for a hybrid device (one with a touch screen and a keyboard) and I’m not sure I believe it’s true. It’s likely they will do this – especially with BlackBerry Device Software 6.0’s cool touch-based UI capabilities, but they’re being pretty closed mouthed about it. Historically every ‘leaked’ BlackBerry device has turned out to be a hoax – I can’t tell you how many times I’d hand a person the BlackBerry Bold 9000 and see them press on the screen. So many web sites said it’d be a touch screen device (even though I knew it wasn’t slated to be) but there has never been a touch screen version and people still push on the screen with their fingers.<\/p>\r\n<p>I’m looking for some more big announcements coming at the conference, but I doubt there’s any more pending. They did announce the dates for the BlackBerry Developer Conference – September 27 through 30.

{"id":"194","asset_id":"223","title":"Writing a Book, Part 1 – Getting Started","alias":"wb1","introtext":"<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/book.jpg\" align=\"left\" \/>After I completed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbdevfundamentals.com\" target=\"_blank\">BlackBerry Development Fundamentals<\/a>, I thought I’d write some articles that outlined some of the process I followed to complete the manuscript. What follows is the first part of a series of articles that document the tools and procedures I used to help make the creation of the manuscript as painless as possible. In this installment, I’ll lay out the issues I had to address and in subsequent articles describe each of the solutions I used to solve them.<\/p>\r\n<p>Writing a large word document is not that hard, but dealing with a complete manuscript (and associated image files) was rather challenging. As I worked, I quickly noticed that I was going to have a problem keeping my chapter files in good shape. I knew I’d be working on the manuscript from both my desktop PC when working at home and my laptop while on the road. The issue then was how do I keep all of the files accurately synchronized between the two systems and how do I maintain the integrity of the files as I worked on them.<\/p>\r\n<p>The first thing I had to concern myself with was what tool I would use to craft the manuscript. Since I’d written a complete, 600 page product manual for <a href=\"adt.wolcottgroup.com\" target=\"_blank\">ADT<\/a> in Word, I knew that I could easily do it there. Having written <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newsoccerref.com\" target=\"_blank\">my first book<\/a> in Word then switched to Adobe FrameMaker for layout, I knew that I didn’t want to do anything with the book in FrameMaker. I thought of using Open Office just for grins or perhaps Google Docs, but I know just how to put Word through its paces, so I knew I had to do all of my writing in Word.<\/p>\r\n<p>The first thing I did then was created a folder for the manuscript and create separate Word documents for each chapter. Since I knew I’d have a different document for each chapter, I knew I wouldn’t have to deal with any issues Word had with large files. I had a pretty good outline of what I wanted in the book (the end book ended up looking nothing like it) so I thought I’d be OK setting up each chapter and plugging through one at a time until I got it done.<\/p>\r\n<p>When I started the project, I forced myself to work on one chapter at a time, in sequence. I knew that if I jumped around, I’d never feel like I was making any real progress and I also knew I’d omit things. I started on chapter one then wrote each chapter in sequence until I completed it. That ended up being a very good decision and allowed me to demonstrate real progress to my publisher. Most published authors I’ve spoken with complained regularly about the schedules imposed on them by their publishers. I was already 6 chapters into the book when I received my contract from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pearson.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Pearson<\/a> and ended up never getting a schedule from my editor. He got chapter by chapter from me in timely installments, so he knew he didn’t have to worry.<\/p>\r\n<p>I made a couple of big mistakes with my manuscript as I started writing…<\/p>\r\n<p>First of all, I put each chapter file into the same folder. This seemed like a good idea until I started associating image files with each chapter. With each of the chapters in the same folder, all of the image files were there too. As I started placing images into the chapters as I worked through them, it got harder and harder to navigate through the folder to get to later chapter’s image files. I quickly learned (well OK, not that quickly; I think I figured this out long past the halfway mark in the book) that the best thing to do was make a separate folder for each chapter and image files. That way, everything was together and it was very easy for me to zip up each chapter folder to submit a chapter to the editor for review. With the files all in one folder, I was able to right click on a folder in Windows Explorer and have WinZip package up all of the files in a zip file already named for the chapter (since the folder already referenced the chapter name). Once I got all that figured out, it became much easier to manage the manuscript files. If you’re writing a novel, you can probably put all chapter files in the same folder; if writing a technical book or a book with a lot of illustrations; use a separate older for each chapter.<\/p>\r\n<p>The second mistake I made was related to the Word Template my publisher wanted me to use. I took a look at it as after I began the project and felt that it was too ugly to work in day to day as I wrote the manuscript. They had a lot of special stuff you had to put in there (like a separate style for the first and last bullets in a list) and I thought it would be easier to write in a generic template then apply the publisher’s template before submitting it for review by the editor. Wrong! As I got further and further into my manuscript, I started having to submit early ones for editing and found myself wasting a lot of time fixing a document (by applying the publisher’s template and applying all of the special styles the publisher wanted me to use) when I should have been finishing up other chapters. When you write a book, get the publisher’s template ASAP and start working with it right away – it will save you a lot of stress later (and ultimately shorten the amount of time required to create the manuscript).<\/p>\r\n<p>OK, now that I’ve described the mistakes I made, let’s dig into the issues I had to address and how I addressed them.<\/p>\r\n<p>The first thing I needed to do was figure out how I was going to be able to keep every possible version of every chapter’s content. Being a developer geek, you’d think I’d use some sort of version control system, but I didn’t have one at my disposal and didn’t want to take the time to set one up and learn its tricks when I just needed to be writing.<\/p>\r\n<p>When working with deliverables for my employer or a customer, I always save a new version of the file every time I open it for editing and use the current date in the file name to keep them separate. What I do is append the date to the end of the file name in the following format: yyyymmdd. Using this format, the file names for a particular file would look like this:{codecitation class=\"brush:text; gutter:false\"}Samplefile 20100131.docx <br \/>Samplefile 20100215.docx <br \/>Samplefile 20100303.docx <br \/>Samplefile 20100421.docx<br \/>{\/codecitation}<\/p>\r\n<p>What happens when you do it this way is Windows automatically sorts the file names by date in the file name. It’s easy to do and automatic in Windows. It always surprises me when people try to do this, but use the date in a different format (mmm-dd-yyyy, mmddyyyy, mmm ddyyyy or ddmmmyyyy) because Windows will sort these alphabetically and December will come before January. If you’re going to append the date to a file name, do it in a way that saves you time later searching for the file (use yyyymmdd format).<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, when it came to my chapter files, I didn’t want to use that approach. I knew that when I submitted the chapter files to the publisher that I had to have them in a particular format (author initials plus chapter number – so: JMW01, JMW02, JMW03 and so on) and I didn’t want to have to rename the files before I submitted them (remove the date from the file name). So, I had to stick with a single file name for each chapter, but still wanted to keep an archival copy of each file. What I ended up doing was using the batch processing capabilities of WinZip to create a file I would execute at the end of every editing session (or in the middle as well if I was making a lot of serious changes) to create a zip archive of the manuscript. By doing this, I used more disk space than I needed to, but had every single version of every file at my disposal. It was never any trouble to go back and find a previous edit of the file. I’ll walk you through how I set this up in a later installment of this series.<\/p>\r\n<p>The next thing I had to do was figure out how to make sure an exact copy of the manuscript was available to me on both my desktop and laptop systems. I knew that Windows has the ability to sync files with the server, but I didn’t want to sync the whole My Documents folder – only the manuscript files. A very long time ago, a customer (Jay Luteran from Euclid Hitachi) introduced me to an award winning piece of software called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.centered.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Second Copy<\/a> from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.centered.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Centered Systems<\/a>. I’ve been using this software package for years and it allows me to easily synchronize files between multiple systems. In a subsequent article in this series, I’ll show you how I used Second Copy to accomplish this.<\/p>\r\n<p>Synchronizing the files ended up creating a huge problem for me as I adjusted the chapters and moved things around; I’ll explain this too in a subsequent article.<\/p>\r\n<p>Another thing I wanted to do was make a single file out of all of the individual chapter files. I wanted this file so I could easily look at the complete page count and occasionally print out a full copy of the manuscript so I could stare at it in awe. What I did to accomplish this was use Adobe Acrobat Professional to create a complete PDF out of each chapter file and use Acrobat’s ‘Combine’ function to merge multiple chapter files into one complete manuscript. I’d written a program to do (in Delphi) a very long time ago, but for some reason the program wasn’t working on Vista 64, so I had to use the tools available from Adobe. Unfortunately with my home grown program, I could save the file list with the project and easily recreate the file by launching the program and clicking a button. For some bizarre reason, Acrobat doesn’t allow you to do that, so you have to select all of the files every time – I wish it worked differently, but Adobe hasn’t been asking me for my opinion.<\/p>\r\n<p>OK, that’s about it – that’s all I have to tell you now. I will be writing subsequent articles that dig deeper into the topics I described above.

{"id":"195","asset_id":"224","title":"Writing a Book, Part 2 – Batch Archiving","alias":"wb2","introtext":"<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/book.jpg\" align=\"left\" \/>As I mentioned in the first article in this series (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=194:writing1&amp;catid=9&amp;Itemid=17\">here<\/a>), I needed a way to have a sort of version control system (VCS) without installing a version control system. I wanted something simple, something that would work regardless of whether I was connected to a network. What I decided to do was use the batch file processing capabilities of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.winzip.com\">WinZip<\/a> to create complete backups of the manuscript (including all documents and images). With this system in place, I could execute the batch process at the end of any editing session (or in the middle if I had a lot of changes) and have a complete backup of everything in case I needed to revert to some older version or dig up some old content I’d deleted and shouldn’t have.<\/p>\r\n<p>Before I begin, it’s probably important to let you know that while I was working on the manuscript and before I had a contract with a publisher, my working title for the book was Fundamentals of BlackBerry Application Development. Throughout this article and others in the series, you’ll probably notice that I named everything with the abbreviated version of the title: FoBAD. What’s funny though is that I also registered a web domain for the book as a placeholder. All of the options I wanted were already taken, so I went ahead and registered bbdevfundamentals.com. I figured I’d grab that domain and later, when I had the final title, at least I’d have a domain to use if the one connected to the official title was taken. As I negotiated with the publisher for the title, imagine my surprise when the final name my publisher came up with was BlackBerry Development Fundamentals which, when abbreviated, matched the name of the domain I already secured for the book’s site.<\/p>\r\n<p>The requirements for the solution were:<\/p>\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The ability to execute the backup without selecting the files I wanted backed up every time<br \/>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The ability to automatically set the backup archive file name using the current date and time – this allowed me to have a unique file name for every backup which would automatically sort as needed in any file listing (Windows Explorer or My Computer).<br \/>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Take up as little file space as possible\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p>Now let’s dig into how to setup the batch process I needed for my project. When you open any of the later versions of WinZip in Classic mode, you’ll see a window similar to the one shown in Figure 1. You’ll need to click on the ‘Backup’ tab to expose the options you need to create batch processes.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/winzip1.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>As highlighted in the figure, select ‘Create’ to create a new backup job. WinZip will prompt you to provide a file name for your backup job. I suggest you put the job somewhere else than the folder you will be backing up. Use either you’re my Documents folder or, as shown in the figure, a folder immediately above the folder you will be backing-up. In this case, I named the file FoBAD Backup.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/winzip2.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2<\/p>\r\n<p>With the WinZip job created, it’s time to start configuring the settings for the backup archive. WinZip uses a wizard metaphor for setting up jobs, so you’ll be stepping through multiple screens as the job’s settings are defined.<\/p>\r\n<p>In the next part of the wizard, you’re prompted to identify the files and folders that are included and excluded from the backup job.&nbsp; In this case, I want to backup the contents of my FoBAD folder, but I don’t want to have to store my backups somewhere else. So, I’m including the FoBAD folder but excluding my Backup folder (as shown in Figure 3. For the manuscript, I also had a folder where I stored all of the source code and research documentation I used as reference for the book. Since the content of that folder never got updated (only new items added to it) I didn’t feel the need to include those files in my backup – it would take up too much hard drive space to be useful and I can always replace the content through an internet search. You can see the folders I’m excluding by looking for the ‘Exc+Sub’ in the Action column in the figure.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/winzip3.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 3<\/p>\r\n<p>Click the ‘Select items…’ button to pick the items that are included and excluded from the backup job. The file selection dialog is shown in Figure 4. Place a check mark on the files or folders you want included.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/winzip4.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 4<\/p>\r\n<p>In the next step of the wizard, you can select which type of backup being performed. For my manuscript backup, I selected a normal backup which grabs all files regardless of the file’s archive attribute setting. You can also use settings that allow for an incremental backup, differential backup or an update (refresh the contents of an existing backup archive).<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/winzip5.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 5<\/p>\r\n<p>Next the wizard prompts you to select some additional settings for the archive. I like to use the selection for relative folder information – that way I don’t end up with the full folder path in my archive. With relative folders set, only the folder structure information below the starting folder is included with each file.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/winzip6.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 6<\/p>\r\n<p>In the next step is where the batch processing capabilities of WinZip become most useful. As you can see in Figure 7, you can specify a root file name for the backup (in the ‘Zip File Name’ field) then append the current date and\/or time to the file name as well.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/winzip7.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 7<\/p>\r\n<p>This feature supports additional options as shown in Figure 8.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/winzip8.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 8<\/p>\r\n<p>You can also click the ‘Subfolder Options…’ button to specify the output folder options shown in Figure 9.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/winzip9.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 9<\/p>\r\n<p>Or you can click the ‘Special Folders…’ button to specify the output folder options shown in Figure 10<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/winzip10.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 10<\/p>\r\n<p>Clicking the next button gives you a summary of the job’s settings as shown in Figure 11.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/winzip11.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 11<\/p>\r\n<p>As this point, what I have is a backup job that backs up my manuscript folder but ignores the Backup and Research folders. The archive is called ‘FoBAD BackupFILEDATETIME.zip’ or ‘FoBAD BackupFILEDATETIME.zipx’ depending on which system I created the backup on. Figure 12 shows a snapshot of my Backup folder listing all of my backups.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/winzip12.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 12<\/p>\r\n<p>Notice the difference between the file extensions on many of the backups. On my laptop I have WinZip configured for Legacy mode (standard Zip file format) but on my desktop I have the new and improved file format in use (zipx). I did this because on my laptop I needed to share zip files with other people who didn’t have a version of zip that supported the new file format. On my desktop I work in isolation, so the format of the zip files doesn’t matter.<\/p>\r\n<p>After the job was all setup, I created a shortcut on my desktop pointing to the backup job. To perform a backup, I merely double-click on the shortcut and the backup launches, runs and closes when it’s all done. The first time you try this, WinZip will ask you whether you wish to execute or edit the job when it’s opened; be sure to tell the program to execute it and you’re all set. You’ll have a quick and easy way to backup any project so you have access to all previous versions.<\/p>\r\n<div style=\"position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 5949px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;\" id=\"_mcePaste\">Look for other articles in the series:<\/div>\r\n<div style=\"position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 5949px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;\" id=\"_mcePaste\"><\/div>\r\n<div style=\"position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 5949px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;\" id=\"_mcePaste\">Writing a Book, Part 1 = Getting Started<\/div>\r\n<div style=\"position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 5949px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;\" id=\"_mcePaste\">Writing a Book, Part 2 – Batch Archiving<\/div>\r\n<div style=\"position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 5949px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;\" id=\"_mcePaste\">Writing a Book, Part 3 – Synchronizing Files<\/div>\r\n<div style=\"position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 5949px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;\" id=\"_mcePaste\">Writing a Book, Part 4 – Fixing File Synchronization Errors<\/div>\r\n<p>Look for other articles in the series:<\/p>\r\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=194:wb1&amp;catid=9&amp;Itemid=17\">Writing a Book, Part 1 = Getting Started<\/a><br \/><a href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=197:wb3&amp;catid=9&amp;Itemid=17\">Writing a Book, Part 3 – Synchronizing Files<\/a><br \/>Writing a Book, Part 4 – Fixing File Synchronization Errors<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2010-05-06 00:49:01","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2010-05-06 00:49:01","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"15","ordering":"109","metakey":"BlackBerry Development Fundamentals, WinZip, Backup, Manuscript","metadesc":"Describes how I used WinZip to allow me to create a complete backup of my manuscript whenever I needed.","access":"1","hits":"21071","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"197","asset_id":"225","title":"Writing a Book, Part 3 – Synchronizing Files","alias":"wb3","introtext":"<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/book.jpg\" align=\"left\" \/>This article is the third in a series about some of the technical hurdles I faced while trying to write <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bbdevfundamentals.com\">BlackBerry Development Fundamentals<\/a> on my laptop (while on the road) and my desktop (when at home).&nbsp; I’m trying to focus on the technical solutions I implemented so that others who begin writing a manuscript can benefit from my experience.&nbsp; The <a href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=194:wb1&amp;catid=9&amp;Itemid=17\">first article in the series<\/a> laid out an overview of the problems and the technical solutions I selected to solve them. The <a href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=195:wb2&amp;catid=9&amp;Itemid=17\">second article <\/a>covered how I was able to ensure that I had a backup copy of every edit I’d made to the manuscript. This article covers how I synchronized the files between my two systems and, spoiler alert, caused some problems by doing so.<\/p>\r\n<p>Looking at the site’s statistics, it’s clear that not many of you are interested in this topic – I’m only getting a few hits on the articles. I’m going to wrap up this series this week (hopefully) then move on to some more interesting topics. In the mean time, here we go…<\/p>\r\n<p>As I mentioned in one of the earlier articles of this series, while I was working on the book, I spent a fair amount of time on the road. It was ultimately a good thing since I was able to work long nights in the hotel room and make better progress on the manuscript without feeling guilty about ignoring my family. Because of this, I needed some way to work on the manuscript from my laptop and my desktop, but I didn’t want to store the files up on a server somewhere – I wanted them physically on whichever system I was working on so that I could access them even if I didn’t have network connectivity (which wasn’t that often, but I didn’t want to have to worry about it).<\/p>\r\n<p>While Windows has the ability to synchronize files with a server, it wouldn’t work in my case because my laptop connected to my work domain and my desktop system didn’t. I didn’t want to have to deal with network domain issues. The solution I selected for this problem is a piece of software I’ve been using for years now called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.centered.com\">Second Copy<\/a>. Second Copy is an award winning synchronization and backup tool that has supported me very well for a great many years. I use the solution to synchronize each system with a Windows server I have in my home office (The server is called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Piranha_Brothers\">Dinsdale<\/a>; Monty Python fans might recognize the name) but it can also be used to write files to removable media.<\/p>\r\n<p>The way I use this solution is to regularly synchronize the contents of my desktop system’s ‘My Documents’ folder to a dedicated drive I have in Dinsdale for backups. Since my laptop was to be used primarily for work purposes, I only synchronized the contents of my laptop’s ‘FoBAD’ folder (described in the second article in the series) with the corresponding folder on Dinsdale.<\/p>\r\n<p>At first, I’d have the synchronization run every two hours, but before long I was getting regularly yelled at by Second Copy as it was trying to synchronize a file I currently had open. I later switched the process so my desktop would synchronize every morning at 6:00 AM (way before I was ever up working on the manuscript) and my laptop would synchronize on startup (as soon as I turned it on after returning from a trip) and every night at about 11 or midnight. With this in place, I had everything synchronizing nicely between the systems and it wasn’t until much later that I realized I’d inadvertently created a problem by using this setup. The problem wasn’t related to Second Copy, it had to do with some rearranging of files I was doing as I worked with the book’s chapters. I’ll explain more about this in the next installment of this series called Writing a Book, Part 4 – Fixing File Synchronization Errors. Stay tuned.<\/p>\r\n<p>Just in case you’re interested in how Second Copy works, I’m going to show below how I setup the synchronization process in the program. When you install Second Copy, it launches on startup and puts a little application in the Windows system tray. It sits there patiently waiting for a scheduled job to begin then kicks off the process at the appropriate time and takes care of my file synchronization needs for me.<\/p>\r\n<p>To setup a job, you have to create a profile; a profile in Second Copy defines actions taken upon a particular file folder on a computer system Second Copy has access to. The figure below shows the profiles I have defined on my desktop system.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2010\/secondcopy0.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>When you create a new profile, Second Copy walks you through a wizard that allows you to select all of the options for the job. The first step in the wizard allows you to select Express or Custom setup for your profile. With Express setup, you’re presented with amore simplified menu of options to use for your profile – this option is for inexperienced users who just want to get something done without looking at every possible option. For the profile I’m setting up here, I’m going to select the Custom option (as shown in the following figure) and click the ‘Next’ button.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2010\/secondcopy1.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2<\/p>\r\n<p>The wizard will next prompt you to select the source folder you will be copying using Second Copy.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2010\/secondcopy2.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 3<\/p>\r\n<p>You can then select to copy all files and folders or only a specific set of files and folders.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2010\/secondcopy3.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 4<\/p>\r\n<p>Once the source files have been selected, the next step is to select the destination folder for the copied files.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2010\/secondcopy4.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 5<\/p>\r\n<p>Of course, if the destination folder does not exist, the program prompts you before creating it.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2010\/secondcopy5.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 6<\/p>\r\n<p>Once the program knows which files it needs to copy and where to copy them to, you’re next prompted to specify when the job sill be scheduled to run. As shown below, you have the ability to specify a specific schedule but also to execute on certain triggers. You can also omit specific days if for example you don’t want the job to run on weekends or run every other day.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2010\/secondcopy6.png\" \/><br \/>Figure 7<\/p>\r\n<p>In the next step, you’re prompted to select the type of copy used for this profile. If you know you’re going to make edits in another copy of the file like I am for this profile, select the Synchronize option. If you want the profile to merely back up the files, then select the Simple Copy or Exact Copy options.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2010\/secondcopy7.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 8<\/p>\r\n<p>Once you’ve selected the type of copy, you’re prompted to select options for the job. In general, I usually synchronize deletions also but ensure that I make multiple backups of any file. This allows me to keep a very clean synchronized copy, but also maintain copies of files I’ve edited or deleted elsewhere. With this in place, I have even more options for recovering from an error.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2010\/secondcopy8.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 9<\/p>\r\n<p>With all of the settings defined for the job, you’re prompted to provide a name for the profile and you’re all set.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2010\/secondcopy9.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 10<\/p>\r\n<p>That’s it for this installment, be sure to check out the other articles in the series:<\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=194:wb1&amp;catid=9&amp;Itemid=17\">Writing a Book, Part 1 = Getting Started<\/a><br \/><a href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=195:wb2&amp;catid=9&amp;Itemid=17\">Writing a Book, Part 2 – Batch Archiving<\/a><br \/>Writing a Book, Part 4 – Fixing File Synchronization Errors<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2010-05-16 21:51:50","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2010-05-16 21:51:50","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"6","ordering":"108","metakey":"Second Copy, Synchronize Files, BlackBerry Development Fundamentals","metadesc":"Third article in a series describing some technological solutions I implemented to help me write the manuscript for BlackBerry Development Fundamentals.","access":"1","hits":"22619","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"198","asset_id":"226","title":"Writing a Book, Part 4 – Fixing File Synchronization Errors","alias":"wb4","introtext":"<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/book.jpg\" align=\"left\" \/>OK, here’s final article in the series. So far I’ve talked about the method I used to backup my manuscript files through every part of the editing process and I’ve covered how I synchronized the files between my laptop and desktop computers as I went. In today’s installment, I’m going to address a problem I created by synchronizing the files between systems. It caught me by surprise several times and forced me to make changes to how I managed the files. Ultimately it’s the reason I decided to write the article series.<\/p>\r\n<p>As I worked through the manuscript, I regularly moved things around within the chapters. I would reorder chapters as I worked through them to get the right order (Research In Motion never, ever, agreed with the placement of chapter 3) and I would rework the order of the content within the chapters as well. On top of all that, as I neared completion of the manuscript and started seeing how long it was going to be (it was approaching 600 pages and I only had a contract for a 400 page book) my editor started whacking images (a lot of them) in order to get the book within the budgeted size.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, one of the things I noticed when I started giving my editor updated copies of each chapter was that the image files for the chapter were getting overwritten with different (wrong) image files. I scratched my head for a while then finally figured out what was going on.<\/p>\r\n<p>Before I tell you what happened, I have to give you a little background. My publisher required that the manuscript be delivered using a particular Word template and a special naming convention for all files. The chapter content would be in a document named using the author’s initials and the chapter number. So, for my book, the chapter files were called JMW01, JMW02, JMW03, and so on. Image files used in the chapter would be named in a similar manner – in this case, it was chapter file name plus an underscore and the sequential image number. So, using the previous example as a guide, the image files for the chapter would be named JMW01_01.jpg, JMW01_02.png, JMW01_03.jpg and so on. It allows for a very structured arrangement for the chapter files and I’m sure saves the editor and production people a lot of time and saved them from extra work trying to make sure they have all the image files required for the book.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now that you understand how the chapter’s files were named; take a look at the following folder listing:<\/p>\r\n<p>{codecitation class=\"brush:text; gutter:false\"}Folder listing of C:\\Users\\John Wargo\\Documents\\Publications\\FoBAD\\JMW01\\<br \/><br \/>Backup of JMW01.wbk&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;8\/11\/2009 9:05:59 AM&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;40 kb<br \/>JMW01.docx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;8\/11\/2009 9:06:30 AM&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;41 kb<br \/>JMW01.zip&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;8\/11\/2009 9:06:36 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;377 kb<br \/>JMW01_01.jpg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4\/10\/2009 7:25:20 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65 kb<br \/>JMW01_02.jpg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4\/1\/2009 7:24:41 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;63 kb<br \/>JMW01_03.jpg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4\/10\/2009 7:24:41 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;63 kb<br \/>JMW01_04.jpg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4\/1\/2009 7:37:29 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73 kb<br \/>JMW01_05.jpg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4\/15\/2009 7:47:13 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71 kb{\/codecitation}<\/p>\r\n<p>As I was removing image files from the manuscript and renaming subsequent files behind it, I was creating a situation where Second Copy thought it was doing the right thing by replacing the local copy of a file with the backed-up copy from the server. Here’s what happened…<\/p>\r\n<p>Say for example I needed to remove image 1 (JMW01_01.jpg) from the manuscript; it was something that wasn’t that important for the book and because of space constraints my editor has asked me to remove it. Now, once the file was been removed, I had to rename all of the following image files so there’s a consistent naming scheme for everything. So, removing the first image file and renaming all of the other files (quite a pain I might say) would result in the following folder listing:<\/p>\r\n<p>{codecitation class=\"brush:text; gutter:false\"}Folder listing of C:\\Users\\John Wargo\\Documents\\Publications\\FoBAD\\JMW01\\<br \/><br \/>Backup of JMW01.wbk&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;8\/11\/2009 9:05:59 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40 kb<br \/>JMW01.docx&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8\/11\/2009 9:06:30 AM&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;41 kb<br \/>JMW01.zip&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8\/11\/2009 9:06:36 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;377 kb<br \/>JMW01_01.jpg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4\/1\/2009 7:24:41 PM&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;63 kb<br \/>JMW01_02.jpg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4\/10\/2009 7:24:41 PM&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;63 kb<br \/>JMW01_03.jpg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4\/1\/2009 7:37:29 AM&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;73 kb<br \/>JMW01_04.jpg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4\/15\/2009 7:47:13 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71 kb{\/codecitation}<\/p>\r\n<p>Now, knowing that Second Copy has been diligently copying all of the files up to the server, it already has a copy of JMW01_01.jpg up on the server and, because of the renaming of the local files, has a different file date and time than the one on my local hard drive (remember, it used to be JMW01_02.jpg and it had a newer file date\/time). The next time Second Copy runs, it’s going to see that the server copy of the file has a newer date\/time stamp than the one on my local hard drive. It’s going to replace the local copy of the file (the former JMW01_02.jpg) with the newer file from the server (the former JMW01_01.jpg).<br \/>When Second Copy gets done with its sync, the old JMW01_02.jpg (now called JMW01_01.jpg) will be replaced by the original JMW01_01.jpg from the server). Because JMW01_03.jpg has replaced JMW01_02.jpg (due to me renaming the files) the old JMW01_02.jpg is gone, deleted by Second Copy as it copied the old JMW01_01.jpg down from the server. Ouch! This created quite a mess.<\/p>\r\n<p>Not only was this process screwing up the files, it was also deleting files that I ultimately needed later. Very painful! It was a lot of work to completely rebuild the file structure every time this happened. I had to rename the files back to where they belonged and retrieve (hopefully) the right version of the archive. Since it might be some time before I noticed the problem I created, I would have to go back archive by archive until I found the one that contained the right version of the file I needed. I was frantically trying to finish the manuscript on schedule and keep my employer and my wife happy and now I’d created more work for myself. Crikey!<\/p>\r\n<p>Note: if the file extensions for the renamed files were different (a .tif file instead of a .jpg file for example) then this would not have created a problem for me. Second Copy would have copied down the old .jpg file and left the .tif file in place. The folder listing would still be broken, but it would be an easier problem to fix.<\/p>\r\n<p>OK, I identified the problem, developed a method for recovering from it, but the next question I had to answer was: ‘how do I keep this from happening again?’ The answer of course is to reset all of the files to the same date\/time before allowing Second Copy to do its thing. If all files are set with the current date\/time stamp, there will be no ‘newer’ versions of the files for Second Copy to find. Since I synchronized before I started working and I know this should be the ‘reference’ version of the files, there’s no risk in doing this.<\/p>\r\n<p>If any of you are old Turbo Pascal developers, you may remember that Borland shipped a little DOS program called touch.com that could be used to reset the date and time stamp of files. Apparently it’s an offshoot from a Unix command of the same name. Anyway, it was a very useful utility and I immediately thought of it for my solution to this problem. The problem is that it’s a DOS program and this was Windows (Vista 64-bit). I probably could have dug up an old copy of the program (yes, I still had my old Turbo Pascal discs) but I was afraid I would encounter side-effects using it so I started looking for something else.<\/p>\r\n<p>Well, I was reading O’Reilly’s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0596527624?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mcnsof-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596527624\">Windows  Vista Annoyances: Tips, Secrets, and Hacks<\/a><img src=\"http:\/\/www.assoc-amazon.com\/e\/ir?t=mcnsof-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0596527624\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" \/> at the time and came across a reference to a product from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.creativelement.com\/\">Creative Element<\/a> called ‘Power Tools’. They had a little utility that would allow me to easily change the date and time for a set of selected files. In an excited frenzy, I downloaded the tools, installed them and went to work.<\/p>\r\n<p>I quickly encountered a problem – I was running Vista 64 and the Power Tools ‘worked’ with that version of Windows, but there were some limitations. In order to be able to use this tool, I had to do it in the 32-bit version of Windows Explorer. Not a big deal, I located the icon for that version of Explorer and went to work.<\/p>\r\n<p>To use the utility, you open Windows Explorer, select the files you want to manipulate the right-click to bring up a list of options.

I realized I was being pretty negative and vowed to publish articles that might really interest people. Unfortunately I can't pass on the opportunity to comment about the market's response to BlackBerry Device Software 6.0.<\/p>\r\n<p>For BoxTone, Vox Mobile and all of those other companies that have hosted webinars on what happened at WES and for BlackBerry Cool and all of those other sites publishing news about BlackBerry - it's NOT called BlackBerry OS 6, it's BlackBerry Device Software 6. Just to make sure I didn’t miss Research In Motion changing what they called it, I confirmed with the ISV team last week that it’s called BlackBerry Device Software 6.<\/p>\r\n<p>The BlackBerry Device Software is the suite of applications that provides the UI and applications the user interacts with on a BlackBerry device. The BlackBerry OS runs underneath the BlackBerry Device Software and provides the OS kernel and a suite of services (low-level routines) that are available to other applications. The BlackBerry Device Software is likely (although I haven’t confirmed this) written in Java and the BlackBerry OS would likely be written in the native machine language for the device (processor). The two work together, but they’re very different things.<\/p>\r\n<p>First of all, the developer really can’t code to the OS, he or she codes to the BlackBerry Device Software and the Device Software interfaces with the OS at some lower level. When Research In Motion releases the Java development tools – they release them in conjunction with a BlackBerry Device Software release, not an OS release. It’s the libraries published through the BlackBerry Device Software that a developer uses to build an application.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you take a look at the screen shot that follows, you’ll see that my BlackBerry Bold 9700 is running BlackBerry Device Software 5.0.0.405 (basically BlackBerry Device Software 5.0) and Platform 5.1.0.112.

The company employees carry BlackBerry devices and most of the company’s customers carry BlackBerry devices, but the company is creating an iPhone application.<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\" style=\"position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;\"><\/div>\r\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\" style=\"position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;\">The CEO carries a BlackBerry but he also has an iPhone (for personal use I guess). During our conversation, he explained how he has a whole bunch of applications on his iPhone and uses them all the time. When I asked him if he had any applications on his BlackBerry, he responded by saying that he didn’t know he could have applications on his BlackBerry. Of course, being a BlackBerry guy, I immediately showed him how to install the BlackBerry App World application on his device and how to search for applications, download them and so on. He was ecstatic and apparently played with his BlackBerry all throughout the meeting that followed ours.<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\" style=\"position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;\"><\/div>\r\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\" style=\"position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;\">After that, I spent some time with the Director of Corporate Communications. As he described what he did and what he expected from us, he (carrying a BlackBerry mind you) explained how he understood that the iPhone really delivered a great user experience. He went on to describe how simple things he needed to do on his BlackBerry were ‘Hooooorrible!’ &nbsp;Of course, being a BlackBerry guy, I waited as long as I could before asking him what types of things he was doing that was causing him so much grief. He explained that when getting his Yahoo! email, performance is horrible and he constantly received a ‘retrieving data’ message on the bottom of the screen while waiting for the mail to load. Of course from hearing that I immediately knew that he was accessing his Yahoo! mail using the browser – and of course he was going to have a poor experience.<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\" style=\"position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;\"><\/div>\r\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\" style=\"position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;\">I immediately explained to him how he could have one corporate and up to 10 personal email accounts delivering mail into his messaging application on his device. I explained how the browser would always be a horrible way to get his mail on a BlackBerry and that was why Research In Motion was so accommodating when it came to mail. I pointed him to www.att.com\/blackberrystart and explained how he could configure his personal mail and interact with it in exactly the same way he worked with his corporate mail, though an application rather than a web browser. I pulled out my device and showed how I had a special Mail folder and listed each of my personal mail icons there. &nbsp;I’m not sure he followed my advice, I sure hope so since it never makes sense to access your mail via the BlackBerry browser.<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\" style=\"position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;\"><\/div>\r\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\" style=\"position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;\">What’s sad though is how everyone assumes that the iPhone experience will be excellent and how certain that the BlackBerry experience is poor. In reality, in both of these cases it was the user’s lack of understanding of what they could do with the device that was tarnishing their experience. No matter what Apple does, the BlackBerry mail experience will always be superior. BlackBerry was built on mail and security and there’s no way anyone can catch up.<\/div>\r\n<p>I was meeting with some executives of a half a billion dollar company last week and was struck by how Research In Motion’s reputation was being tarnished due to lack of understanding about the BlackBerry platform’s capabilities.

Of course, being a BlackBerry guy, I immediately showed him how to install the BlackBerry App World application on his device and how to search for applications, download them and so on. He was ecstatic and apparently played with his BlackBerry all throughout the meeting that followed ours.<\/p>\r\n<p>After that, I spent some time with the Director of Corporate Communications. As he described what he did and what he expected from us, he (carrying a BlackBerry mind you) explained how he understood that the iPhone really delivered a great user experience. He went on to describe how simple things he needed to do on his BlackBerry were ‘Hooooorrible!’ &nbsp;Of course, being a BlackBerry guy, I waited as long as I could before asking him what types of things he was doing that was causing him so much grief. He explained that when getting his Yahoo! email, performance is horrible and he constantly received a ‘retrieving data’ message on the bottom of the screen while waiting for the mail to load. Of course from hearing that I immediately knew that he was accessing his Yahoo! mail using the browser – and of course he was going to have a poor experience.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>I immediately explained to him how he could have one corporate and up to 10 personal email accounts delivering mail into his messaging application on his device. I explained how the browser would always be a horrible way to get his mail on a BlackBerry and that was why Research In Motion was so accommodating when it came to mail. I pointed him to www.att.com\/blackberrystart and explained how he could configure his personal mail and interact with it in exactly the same way he worked with his corporate mail, though an application rather than a web browser. I pulled out my device and showed how I had a special Mail folder and listed each of my personal mail icons there. &nbsp;I’m not sure he followed my advice, I sure hope so since it never makes sense to access your mail via the BlackBerry browser.<\/p>\r\n<p>What’s sad though is how everyone assumes that the iPhone experience will be excellent and how certain that the BlackBerry experience is poor. In reality, in both of these cases it was the user’s lack of understanding of what they could do with the device that was tarnishing their experience. No matter what Apple does, the BlackBerry mail experience will always be superior. BlackBerry was built on mail and security and there’s no way anyone can catch up.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"2","created":"2010-07-24 00:52:11","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2010-07-24 00:52:11","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"1","ordering":"32","metakey":"BlackBerry, iPhone, BlackBerry App World, Email, Yahoo!","metadesc":"It's clear that RIM's reputation is being tarnished because of a lack of understanding of what the platform can do.","access":"1","hits":"6995","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

Because my publsiher is involved with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.safaribooksonline.com\">Safari Books Online<\/a>, an early draft of my book went online there in June '09 so I felt comfortable saying my book was the 'first' BlackBerry Development book on the market.Craig Johnston published Professional BlackBerry in 2005, but although it was touted as a BlackBerry development book, there really wasn't much 'development' in it.<\/p>\r\n<p>About the same time BlackBerry Development Fundamentals, my wife found a reference on the Internet for Anthony Rizk's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1430272252?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mcnsof-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1430272252\">Beginning BlackBerry Development<\/a><img src=\"http:\/\/www.assoc-amazon.com\/e\/ir?t=mcnsof-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1430272252\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" \/> and the race was on to see which book 'published' first. Anthony and I both launched our books at the BlackBerry Developer Conference in San Jose in November of 2009 - He gave away a few copies of his book on the last day of the conference and my publisher had 75 copies on hand, setup a booth and had a book signing. It was a lot of fun.<\/p>\r\n<p>I regularly monitored Amazon to see what other BlackBerry-related books were scheduled to be released and saw that Apress (the publisher of Anthony's book) had several titles in the works. Eventually Wrox got into the game and added their '<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0470547472?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mcnsof-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0470547472\">Professional Blackberry Java Development<\/a><img src=\"http:\/\/www.assoc-amazon.com\/e\/ir?t=mcnsof-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0470547472\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" \/> ' by David Williams to the book listing on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dgno%5Flogo&amp;tag=mcnsof-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957\">amazon.com<\/a>. Of course I've read all of the other BlackBerry development books - I've even written reviews of them for Doctor Dobb's Journal (if I can only get them published), so I had to order this one so I could see what I could learn. The book was supposed to be published in Feburary, but never did. Back in May, I received a notification from amazon that they were unable to acquire the book for me. Apparantly Wrox isn't getting back into the BlackBerry book market.<\/p>\r\n<p>BlackBerry Development Fundamentals came out right before RIM finalized Widgets and some other technologies, but since I actually finished the book months before it was published, it was still too beta for me to include in the manuscript. I intended to go back and do an update around Widgets and App World and perhaps with RIM's announcement of BlackBerry Device Software 6.0 I will do some digging and update the book. We'll see.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you hear of any new BlackBerry books, let me know.

I was checking in for a flight home and thought I'd try the new boarding pass on the mobile device thing. I finished my check-in and had the airline send the boarding pass to my work email account. I opened the message and clicked on the link to bring up the mobile boarding pass. It's a web page and the page had some instructions for how to make it easy to load the page while at the airport.

I noticed two interesting things while we were at the park. One was an interesting marketing trick and another was an interesting use of technology.<\/p>\r\n<p>Living in North Carolina, we get more nice weather than we were use to in Northeastern Ohio. I loved Cedar Point, but never seemed to make it there. With the nicer weather here, I can go from March to November, much longer than I could at Cedar Point.<\/p>\r\n<p>As we walked around the park, they repeatedly made announcements indicating that we could trade in today’s admission price against a season pass for the 2011. Regular price was about $50 (plus $10 for parking) and with a discount received by delivering one canned Coke product for each of us, we were able to enter the park for $35 each. Expensive for a fall day, but not a bad deal considering it would have been $50 otherwise ($200 for the 4 of us). The additional cost for a season pass for next year was $30 for each of us. That meant, for less than the cost of admission today, we get an entire season of free admission plus free parking. Not a bad deal.<\/p>\r\n<p>The acquisition price for a new season pass holder must be pretty high or sales must be pretty low for them to offer this deal. We know we’re going to go at least once next year, so no matter what we’ve saved money on this deal. Nice.<\/p>\r\n<p>As you probably know, they take pictures everywhere at the park and try to get you to buy them. When we rode the first ride that generated a picture, it was interesting to see them offer putting the photo on a USB memory drive for the same price as a printed picture. Nice idea – I get an electronic copy of the photo and don’t have to carry a print with me everywhere I go.<\/p>\r\n<p>There’s got to be a mobile application in here somewhere.<\/p>\r\n<p>I’m thinking that an amusement park could offer customers a mobile application to help make this even easier. You download a free copy of the mobile application before going to the park then enter in your credit card information. As you finish the ride and get funneled through the area to view the photos that were just taken, you can acquire the photo directly from your mobile phone; nothing to carry around the remainder of the day. When you find a picture you like, you enter the ride number then the photo number. Your credit card could be charged directly and you could even be offered a discount by using the application. It would certainly cost the amusement park less money since there’d be no printing or copying files to a memory stick that would just get lost. The photo could be emailed to the device, sent via MMS or even downloaded directly to the application running on the phone. <br \/>Yeah, that would be something I would be interested in. I’d probably buy more photos.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2010-09-11 22:56:57","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2010-09-11 22:56:57","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"1","ordering":"104","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"8238","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

Last year’s application was written by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.sweetcaesar.com\/\">Sweet Caesar<\/a> and, while functional, it was hard to use – they’d tried too hard to build in all sorts of screen effects and because of it the application was unusable.

It’s based on Pyxis Mobile Enterprise Application Platform which allows a company to build one application and run it on multiple mobile platforms. <br \/>When Pyxis built the application, they didn’t go overboard with the screen transitions, they just built a simple application that got the job done. Just what was needed. Here’s a screen shot of the application – the only issue I have with it so far is that there’s not enough space between the menu items – on a touch screen device it’s hard to select the right menu item, I always seem to select the one I don’t want.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/screenshot-sep2710-103132a.jpg\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>In every session today they reminded everyone to fill out their session evaluations – either on the conference’s web site or using the mobile application.

{"id":"215","asset_id":"243","title":"BlackBerry App Problem with 6.0","alias":"bb6problems","introtext":"<p>At the BlackBerry Developer conference opening session yesterday they highlighted a bunch of consumer applications that they, RIM, thought were interesting, ground breaking or at least fun. What I noticed though was that many of them were not available yet for a device running BlackBerry Device Software 6.0. In the session they demonstrated the dictionary.com, not available yet for BlackBerry 6.0. They highlighted the things Xobni has done (cool product), not yet available for BlackBerry 6.0. The amazon app? Not available in the App World (it's available for download directly, but it's not where the other standard BlackBerry apps can be found).<\/p>\r\n<p>Apparently moving an application to Device Software 6 is more problematic than expected.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Another thing that was very clear yesterday was that RIM is solely focused on consumer devices and consumer applications. The BlackBerry Playbook is for Enterprises mostly, so that's an exception. 90% of what they talked about yesterday in the opening session, except for the Playbook, was focused entirely on consumer-focused application.<\/p>\r\n<p>With the new BlackBerry Messenger integration capabilities and the libraries for connecting to Twitter and Facebook, their intention is clear - make it as easy as possible for developers to build social networking into their apps. The question I have though is when is enough enough? How many applications do I need on my device that integrate with Twitter and Facebook? Do I really need that? I have a Facebook app, I have a Twitter app, why do I need all of my other applications to interface with those services? What's going to be happening soon (and has probably already started to happen) is that users will have too many applications. The BlackBerry, iPhone and other platforms can supported a limited number of applications - before long you'll be deleting stuff you don't use that often to make room. When all of my apps share common features, like interfacing with Twitter or Facebook, how do I then distinguish between separate apps?<\/p>\r\n<p>One of the examples Mike Kirkup showed in the session was a hardware dongle you could attach to your car keys to a BlackBerry application can track them. One of the differentiating features he showed was that the tracking application integrated with Facebook and Twitter. That way you can quickly let all of your friends and followers know when you've lost your keys. Seriously? How is that important? How often do you lose your keys? Am I going to tweet when I lost my keys? Possibly, just in case I was with some of my followers recently (when I last saw my keys) Post on Facebook about it? Possibly, but why don't I just use my Facebook or Twitter apps for that? &nbsp;Even better use an aggregater to do it, but why does that functionality need to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">also<\/span> be in the key finder app?<\/p>\r\n<p>People are going to quickly realize that a big percentage of their device memory is being taken up by features of many applications that duplicate eachother.

{"id":"216","asset_id":"244","title":"It's the BlackBerry Browser's Fault","alias":"its-the-blackberry-browsers-fault","introtext":"<p>I'm regularly asked to help suggest a solution for customer having problems using the BlackBerry browser to access certain sites or applications. It's a common problem and rarely actually a problem with the BlackBerry browser. I thought I'd spend some time to talk about what's going on here and hopefully make you understand what's usually going on.<\/p>\r\n<h3>The BlackBerry Browser<\/h3>\r\n<p>One of the things Research In Motion gets dinged on regularly is the browser, but it's important to note that Research In Motion worked deliberately to make the BlackBerry Browser small, fast and secure. What people see as faults in the BlackBerry Browser are in reality just the side effect of Research In Motion designing the browser for mobile web sites, NOT for viewing desktop web sites. Expecting that mobile web developers would build text-based web sites with limited flash (pun intended) for mobile users, they built a browser specifically for that need.<\/p>\r\n<p>The BlackBerry browser is a standard browser. All of the standard web technologies you'd expect to be supported are supported. There might be a delay in implementation of a particular technology, such as Adobe Flash for example, but Research In Motion generally implements anything they think regular, everyday web sites use. Recognizing that the world has changed, and the market expects web sites viewed on a mobile device to look and feel like the desktop version (which they shouldn't in my opinion), Research In Motion acquired Torch Mobile and implemented Apple's WebKit web rendering engine in BlackBerry Device Software 6.0.<\/p>\r\n<h4>Web Site Issues<\/h4>\r\n<p>So, now that we have a little background on the BlackBerry Browser, let's dig into some of the problems you'll encounter when accessing web applications on a BlackBerry Browser. I'm going to focus primarily on commercial web applications that companies will often be using on their desktop computers and all of a sudden want to extend those applications to mobile devices. The same problems can be encountered in home grown web applications, but generally those are usually simpler applications and aren't doing weird things (I'll explain soon).<\/p>\r\n<h4>ActiveX Controls<\/h4>\r\n<p>The biggest problem that plagues web applications running on mobile devices is that many commercial applications utilize ActiveX controls to provide some interesting functionality for the application. ActiveX controls are essentially Windows programs that Microsoft has allowed web developers to wedge into their applications. They provide more interesting looking forms, more dynamic content and much of the same things Java Applets provided web users back in the 90's. The only difference is that they're written using Microsoft's technologies rather than industry standards.<\/p>\r\n<p>The problem with ActiveX controls (actually, there's many – but I'm not going to get into that here) is that since they're a Microsoft technology, they only work in Microsoft's browser (Internet Explorer - IE). They leverage specific hooks Microsoft has implemented in Internet Explorer (and essentially no other browsers) and allow developers to do some pretty cool things.<\/p>\r\n<p>The problem that affects mobile users is that IE is not available on anything but a device running Windows Mobile (or the new Windows Phone) operating systems.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you have a web application that ONLY works on Internet Explorer and you encounter problems running the application on a BlackBerry, you need to ask some questions.<\/p>\r\n<blockquote>Does the application leverage ActiveX controls?<\/blockquote>\r\n<p>If the answer is yes, then the application is never going to work in the BlackBerry Browser as is. It would have to be rewritten to work on other browsers. When your customer or the application's end users start to complain about this limitation, you'll need to ask them another question:<\/p>\r\n<blockquote>For desktop users, does it work on any other browser than Internet Explorer? Something like Firefox, Google Chrome or Opera?<\/blockquote>\r\n<p>If the answer is no, then how could they be complaining that it doesn't work on the BlackBerry when it clearly doesn't work on anything except IE? If the application was coded to IE, then it either uses specific features of IE (and won't therefore work on a BlackBerry) or it was written to address specific limitations within IE (and won't therefore work on a BlackBerry either). You're stuck and shouldn't spend much time trying to fix something that can't be fixed.<\/p>\r\n<p>If the answer to the last question was yes, then perhaps you have some more work to do. If the app works on most desktop browsers but not the BlackBerry Browser, then there could be something else going on (although still I'm not willing to blame the BlackBerry Browser for this) and you'll need to look at the next two sections for more information.<\/p>\r\n<h4>Browser Detection<\/h4>\r\n<p>It's hard for a lot of people to recognize this, but the browser a browser and if an application you're running uses standard web technologies such as HTML, JavaScript and CSS, it should work just fine anywhere. When you encounter a problem where a web application works on one or more desktop browsers but then fails on one or more mobile browsers, it's possible that the server is doing something to break the application on the mobile devices.<\/p>\r\n<p>A more sophisticated web application will detect what browser is running the application and adjust the content appropriately. Sending desktop content for desktop browsers and smaller, more compact and feature restricted content to a mobile device. To help do this, the browser automatically sends with every request to the server some information about what browser it is and what web technologies\/features it supports.  The web application retrieves this information (by accessing the HTTP header values USER-AGENT and ACCEPTS) and makes some decisions about what to send to the device.<\/p>\r\n<p>What I've seen when an application breaks when running on a BlackBerry device is that the web application running on the server was coded to recognize specific browsers and when it encountered the HTTP USER-AGENT header from the BlackBerry Browser, it didn't know what to do and either sent an incomplete page (because of an error in the program) or nothing at all (since it didn't recognize the client requesting the page).<\/p>\r\n<p>What should happen is the server sends a page to the browser with content announcing that the specific device being used is unsupported by the application. Developers should not leave their users hanging; they should always let them know when something happens that prohibits the application from working. In most cases when I've looked at problems with an application running on the BlackBerry Browser it's because of this, the app wasn't built to recognize the BlackBerry and sent an incomplete page or limited data to the browser. This causes the BlackBerry Browser to display a blank white page and convinces the end user that the BlackBerry Browser is broken.<\/p>\r\n<p>The way to confirm what is being sent to the BlackBerry Browser by the web server is to view the page's source code. By looking at the page source, you can see exactly what the server sent and see if anything was sent at all. To view the page's source, open the application in the browser then hold down the keyboard's ALT key and type RBVS (which stands I think for RIM BlackBerry View Source). When you finish typing those four characters and release the ALT key, the BlackBerry source viewer application will open and display the source for the page as shown in Figure 1.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/screenshot-nov1810-073702a.jpg\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1 – The BlackBerry Browser Source Viewer<\/p>\r\n<p>You can then poke through the code looking for what's happening with the application. If the page contains properly formatted HTML, then the BlackBerry Browser will render it just fine, if not, you've found the source (no pun intended) of your problem.<\/p>\r\n<p>To make it easier for you, the BlackBerry Browser source viewer allows you to send the page source via email, so you can just forward the code to your desktop email client and view it in a more eye-friendly way.<\/p>\r\n<p>Again, 9 times out of 10 when I am pointed at an web application that doesn't 'work' on the BlackBerry Browser, I find that when I open the page's source that the web server didn't send valid HTML or any HTML to the browser. The problem is clearly on the web server or within the web application, not the BlackBerry Browser.<\/p>\r\n<h4>Manipulating the DOM<\/h4>\r\n<p>Another reason web applications fail on BlackBerry devices is because the web application was written to use JavaScript to manipulate the applications pages client side (within the browser). While this isn't generally a problem, many web applications do this; it's just that this feature of web applications didn't work on BlackBerry devices until recently (BlackBerry Device Software 4.6). The browser exposes a web page's content to JavaScript through the Document Object Model (DOM). By manipulating the DOM, JavaScript code running within a web page can actually change the page's content dynamically –  either moving content in and out depending on user action or pulling new data into the application dynamically using AJAX. Unfortunately, when Research In Motion built the early BlackBerry Browser, they didn't allow JavaScript to change a page's content through the DOM. JavaScript could read the DOM and understand what content was available, but it was read-only – no changes could be made. I expect Research In Motion did this because they expected that mobile web sites wouldn't need this ability and they were very late to add this capability once they recognized it was needed by their customers.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, if you have a web application that renders content correctly on the BlackBerry Browser but doesn't 'work' as expected you will need to ask:<\/p>\r\n<blockquote>Does the application use JavaScript to manipulate page content within the browser?<\/blockquote>\r\n<p>If the answer is yes and the device in question is running a version of the BlackBerry Device Software older than 4.6, the user is going to have to upgrade their device in order to run the application. Unfortunately there's no way around this; it's a limitation of the BlackBerry Browser, it's well documented and it's been fixed in later versions of the BlackBerry Device Software.<\/p>\r\n<p>If the answer is yes and the device in question is running BlackBerry Device Software 4.6 or higher, then the problem is very easy to fix. Even though BlackBerry Device Software 4.6 implemented a read-write DOM (rather than the read-only DOM from previous versions), JavaScript for some bizarre reason was turned off by default.  You should be able to open browser options, enable JavaScript, reload the page in the browser and see that all is well with the application. With BlackBerry Device Software 6, Research In Motion finally enabled JavaScript by default.<\/p>\r\n<p>You can actually build your web site so it turns the JavaScript on by default, you can read about this feature in BlackBerry Development Fundamentals (www.bbdevfundamentals.com) or I've written an article about it here: <a href=\"index.php\/blackberry\/programmatically-enabling-javascript-in-the-blackberry-browser.html.\">http:\/\/johnwargo.com\/index.php\/blackberry\/programmatically-enabling-javascript-in-the-blackberry-browser.html.<\/a><\/p>\r\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\r\n<p>Hopefully I've proven that when a web application encounters problems running on a BlackBerry Browser that it's not always a problem or bug in the BlackBerry Browser. Developers can do things that cause problems for mobile devices or leverage desktop web features that are not fully implemented on mobile devices. Your best course of action when you encounter problems like I've described here is to dig deeper into the problem and try to understand where the problem is – it's not always in the browser.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"2","created":"2010-11-18 13:38:52","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2016-04-13 00:19:11","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2010-11-18 13:38:52","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"3","ordering":"25","metakey":"BlackBerry Browser, problems","metadesc":"A study of why when people report problems with an application running in the BlackBerry Browser that it's not always the fault of the BlackBerry browser.","access":"1","hits":"7996","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

If you right-click the Sizer system tray icon and select ‘Configure Sizer…’ from the menu that appears, you will be presented with a screen similar to the one shown in Figure 2. <br \/><br \/> <img src=\"images\/stories\/sizer_config.png\" \/><br \/>Figure 2 – Sizer Configuration Dialog<\/p>\r\n<p>From this dialog, you configure the different window sizes you wish to be able to use when resizing windows. You can set specific window dimensions or use the program to set a specific window position.&nbsp; When you have the settings configured the way you want them, click the OK button and you’re ready to go.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Using the Program<\/h3>\r\n<p>To resize the window, right click on the window’s title bar and you will be presented with a menu similar to the one shown in Figure 3. At this point, you can select one of the pre-configured window sizes and Sizer will resize the window to the selected dimensions, keeping the window’s upper left corner in the current position (unless you selected an option that also moves the window).<br \/><br \/> <img src=\"images\/stories\/sizer_rightclick.png\" \/><br \/>Figure 3 – Sizer Context Menu<\/p>\r\n<p>The program works pretty well and I’ve used it for many, many years now. It’s proven to be very useful and well worth the cost (it’s free!) What bothers me though is that some windows won’t display the context menu. The Windows Explorer application in Vista 64 won’t display the context menu when you right-click on the title bar. It’s not really a problem though since I can still select the window and resize it by right-clicking on the system tray icon then picking a window dimension from the pre-configured list. <br \/>If you’re looking for a way to resize windows quickly and easily – give this free utility a try.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2010-12-17 17:55:10","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2010-12-17 17:55:10","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"6","ordering":"103","metakey":"Brian Apps, Sizer, resize windows","metadesc":"How to use Sizer to resize windows in Windows","access":"1","hits":"6903","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

Through a web interface you as a customer have access to, you can install applications on a device plus pull logs and other information from the device and interact with it. What surprised me was that they also offer a scripting language you can use to automate testing on the device; pretty cool. I still need to play with this directly, but as I understand it you can write scripts that poke and prod at the device, which I expected they could do through interfacing with the keyboard buffer and other API's the device manufacturers provide. You can even swipe through menus and click menu items , buttons and application icons. Again, I don't have all of the details, but apparently you can provide an image that the scipt uses to identify a menu item or application icon to click - as your script moves things around on the device, you can configure it to click when it finds the particular item you're looking for. So, if a menu item or application's icon position changes depending on what other applications are installed on the device, your script can still find it.<\/p>\r\n<p>I'll be taking a real look at this solution after the holidays and I'll let you know what I find out.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"15","created":"2010-12-22 18:21:36","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2010-12-22 18:21:36","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"1","ordering":"24","metakey":"Perfecto Mobile, mobile application testing, BlackBerry Development Fundamentals","metadesc":"First impressions of the Perfecto Mobile solution","access":"1","hits":"9903","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

The author tried to tell the story, but spent way too much time talking about other stuff that wasn't really related to what was happening with Chandler. It's like he wanted to write a book about this cool open source project, but wanted to write the book for non-developers. There are sections and chapters dedicated to providing some background on the technology and problems faced by development organization – I guess there to help the non-developer understand the background.

{"id":"227","asset_id":"255","title":"The Verizon iPhone","alias":"verizon-iphone","introtext":"<p>I've said this for a long time now and I'm speaking for myself, NOT my employer: The best thing that can happen to AT&amp;T is for Verizon to get the iPhone. As I've written here before, Apple doesn't care about the network, they just don't. So, Verizon getting the iPhone is going to really show how good AT&amp;T's network really is.<\/p>\r\n<p>What's interesting is the \"Verizon Deal May Expose iPhone Flaws\" article in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/01\/15\/business\/15nocera.html\">New york Times<\/a>. Like the wired article of last summer, it's a good, even, balanced &amp; impartial look at the iPhone. Some parts of the article that struck me as interesting (and true):<\/p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Yet for all that it offers, the iPhone has always been plagued by  serious drawbacks. The “phone” part of the iPhone has never worked very  well, dropping calls with annoying regularity. Even when the phone  works, the sound quality is often substandard. You would think in an age  when fewer people are using landlines this would matter. Apparently  not.<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<p>If I'm on the phone with someone and the call drops, when they call back I always ask them \"you're on an iPhone, right?\" I don't get dropped calls on my BlackBerry, so if two phones are on the same network and the calls drop more frequently for the one phone vs. the other, which is it? The phone or the network?&nbsp; It's the phone.<\/p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the iPhone’s lack of a raised keyboard makes it next to  impossible to do serious e-mailing. And users have to worry constantly  about battery life; if they’re not judicious, the iPhone’s battery can  be drained by noon.<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<p>Yeah, how good is a phone if the battery won't last past noon?<\/p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>“People so love their devices from Apple that they are willing to put up  with the stupidities,” said Larry Keeley,  president of the innovation  and design firm Doblin. “For many users,” he added, “especially the ones  Apple loves the most, the fact that the battery gets balky is how you  convince yourself to get a new one.”<\/p>\r\n<p>My oldest son, Amato, who is on my Verizon Wireless plan, told me  recently that even though he was perfectly happy with his Android phone,  if given the chance to switch to an iPhone, he would probably do it. “I  can’t even say why,” he said. “I don’t even know if there is any real  rationale behind that desire.”<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<p>True, very true - People are going to buy one no matter how good it is (or isn't).<\/p>\r\n<p>Why not support Verizon's 4g network? That one makes no sense - right after the launch of LTE for Verizon (although Verizon's implementation of LTE isn't 4g, not yet).&nbsp; Check out the quote:<\/p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>At the Verizon Wireless-iPhone extravaganza on Tuesday — in which the two companies announced that the iPhone 4 would run on Verizon Wireless’s 3G network — Apple’s chief operating officer, Timothy D. Cook, was asked why Apple wasn’t going with the carrier’s faster, newer 4G LTE network. Mr. Cook replied that doing so required “design compromises” that Apple was unwilling to make.<br \/><br \/>They never make design compromises at Apple. They make consumer compromises. Yet consumers have always been willing to overlook those compromises so they can claim they own some of the coolest products on the planet.<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<p>I'm sticking with my BlackBerry, thank you.

{"id":"229","asset_id":"257","title":"Mobilizing Domino Data Using REST Part 1","alias":"domino-rest","introtext":"<p>{emailcloak=off}The first part of a series on mobilizing IBM Lotus Domino data for mobile platforms that don’t directly support XML-based Web Services (like Android and the iPhone).<\/p>\r\n<h2>Introduction<\/h2>\r\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong> removed obsolete attachments November 11, 2022<\/p>\r\n<p>Back when I worked for Research in Motion, I presented topics at Lotusphere and the View Developer Conference on how to connect to Domino databases from rich client applications on BlackBerry. Research in Motion had some pretty cool tools at the time (MDS Studio) that made it painfully easy – I could build a BlackBerry application that talked to a Domino Web Service in about 3 minutes.<\/p>\r\n<p>Beginning with BlackBerry Device Software 4.2, Research in Motion added the ability to connect to Web Services from a BlackBerry Java application (using JSR 172), so I added building a BlackBerry Java application to my set of demos. I then wrote a series of articles on this site that documented the whole process. Here are links to the articles:<\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=45:dbja1&amp;catid=3:domino&amp;Itemid=137\">Domino &amp; BlackBerry Java Applications Part 1<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"index.php\/BlackBerry\/dbja2.html\">Domino &amp; BlackBerry Java Applications Part 2<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"index.php\/miscellaneous\/bbdja25.html\">Domino &amp; BlackBerry Java Applications Part 2.5<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"index.php\/blackberry\/bbdja3.html\">Domino &amp; BlackBerry Java Applications Part 3 <\/a><\/p>\r\n<ul><\/ul>\r\n<p>After I left Research in Motion, I continued to present at the same conferences and added the Midwest Lotus User Group (MWLUG) conference to my standard tour. Because of the Web Services capabilities of Microsoft Visual Studio, it was pretty easy to add a demo of a Windows Mobile application to my presentations as well.<\/p>\r\n<p>The iPhone and Android platforms were released without the ability to connect to XML-based Web services, so I had to find a different way for those platforms to connect to Domino. Android includes the JSON libraries from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.json.org\" rel=\"noopener\">json.org<\/a>, and there were several versions of JSON libraries for the iPhone platform up there as well, so I decided I’d use REST and JSON to accommodate Android and iPhone. At Lotusphere 2010, while recovering from pneumonia, I added an Android demo to the presentation and was even able to show an almost complete (I never finished it) iPhone example as well. At the conference I promised I’d publish an article here demonstrating how I built the Android application, so here it begins (finally). This article is the first part of a new series that’s all about how to use REST and JSON to mobilize Domino data on Android. There’ll be two articles in this series here, plus I’ll eventually publish an article in the View illustrating the iPhone application.<\/p>\r\n<h2>The Sample Application<\/h2>\r\n<p>In case you missed the first part of this series, the application we’re building here allows a mobile user to lookup contacts in the Domino Directory. The assumption here is that most every Domino customer has some extra database of contacts and mobile users will need the ability to lookup contact information. This is the same process as demonstrated in the original series; it’s just modified so it leverages JSON instead of Web Services.<\/p>\r\n<h2>About REST<\/h2>\r\n<p>REST stands for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Representational_State_Transfer\" rel=\"noopener\">Representational State Transfer<\/a> and essentially it’s a form of Web Service where parameters for a request are sent on the URL to the server and the server’s response is returned in the body of the HTTP response typically in XML or JSON format although it could be in any format. RESTful Web Services are much easier to use then XML Web Services since it’s so much less work to call the service and there’s much less overhead when the data is returned as JSON rather than XML.<\/p>\r\n<h2>About JSON<\/h2>\r\n<p>JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and it’s a way of representing data in a textual format that’s easy to parse and manipulate. To quote json.org (www.json.org):<\/p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>“JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.<\/p>\r\n<p>JSON is built on two structures:<\/p>\r\n<p>* A collection of name\/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.<\/p>\r\n<p>* An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.<\/p>\r\n<p>These are universal data structures. Virtually all modern programming languages support them in one form or another. It makes sense that a data format that is interchangeable with programming languages also be based on these structures.”<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<p>In JSON, an array looks like this:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/jsonarray.gif\" \/><br \/>And an Object looks like this:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/jsonobject.gif\" \/><br \/>You’ll see how these apply in the following section.<\/p>\r\n<p>*JSON Images shamelessly ‘borrowed’ from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.json.org\" rel=\"noopener\">www.json.org<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Designing the JSON Agent<\/h2>\r\n<p>In the Web Services version of the agent I created for the BlackBerry and Windows Mobile versions of the mobile application, I created a single service that supported two operations: GetUserList and GetUserDetails. Since the needs for this application were for there to be the same two operations and each operation would be called by a URL, it would seem to make sense to make a separate Domino web agent for each operation. Unfortunately, that approach would require two agents and a bunch of duplicated code between them, so I decided to create a single agent that exposed the two operations through a single interface. So, there is going to be a single Domino agent called by the mobile application and different results would be returned to the calling program depending on what information is passed on the URL to the Domino server.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, the URL a mobile application will be using to use the service will look like this:{codecitation class=\"brush:text; gutter:false\"}http:\/\/server\/database.nsf\/domdirlookuprest?openagent&amp;cmd=COMMAND&amp;searchstr=SEARCHSTRING{\/codecitation}<\/p>\r\n<p>Where the ‘cmd=’ and ‘searchStr=’ portions of the URL are places where the calling program can pass in parameters to control what the service returns.<\/p>\r\n<p>To obtain a list of contacts whose last name begins with ‘war’, the mobile application will call the following URL:{codecitation class=\"brush:text; gutter:false\"}http:\/\/server_name\/bbnames.nsf\/domdirlookuprest?openagent&amp;cmd=list&amp;searchstr=war{\/codecitation}<\/p>\r\n<p>In this case, the cmd is ‘list’ and the searchStr is ‘War’ – when the agent runs on the Domino server, it will return the following JSON array (assuming that there are two contacts defined in the database whose last names begin with War):{codecitation class=\"brush:text; gutter:false\"}[\"John Wargo\", \"Anna Wargo\"]{\/codecitation}<\/p>\r\n<p>Once a mobile application’s user selects a contact, the agent is called again with the following URL:{codecitation class=\"brush:text; gutter:false\"}http:\/\/localhost\/bbnames.nsf\/domdirlookuprest?openagent&amp;cmd=details&amp;searchstr=john+wargo{\/codecitation}<\/p>\r\n<p>In this case, the cmd is ‘details’ and the searchStr is my contact name. When the agent runs on the Domino server, it will return the following JSON object (notice that the first call, the call to get the list, returns a JSON array, while the second call (for the details) returns an object):<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">{codecitation class=\"brush:text; gutter:false\"}{<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">&nbsp; \"FullName\" : \"John Wargo\", <\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">&nbsp; \"LastName\" : \"Wargo\", <\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">&nbsp; \"FirstName\" : \"John\", <\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">&nbsp; \"EmailAddress\" : \"someguy@some-email.com\", <\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">&nbsp; \"OfficePhone\" : \"330.123.4567\", <\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">&nbsp; \"MobilePhone\" : \"330.987.6543\"<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">}{\/codecitation}<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>That’s it, that’s all there is to the agent I’m showing you how to build in this article.<\/p>\r\n<p>Probably asking yourself “Why not use the JSON capabilities already built into Domino to provide this functionality?” Well, Domino’s ability to generate JSON output is designed for rendering views in a format that’s easy for an application to process. Using the following URL:<\/p>\r\n<p>{codecitation class=\"brush:text; gutter:false\"}http:\/\/server1\/database.nsf.nsf\/viewname?ReadViewEntries&amp;OutputFormat=JSON{\/codecitation}<\/p>\r\n<p>would cause the Domino server to render the view as JSON, it doesn’t help us here because we’re passing in search strings and trying to retrieve only one document. It could be done (I think) with a single category view, but taking that approach was much more work than I wanted to do.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Building the JSON Agent<\/h2>\r\n<p>Let’s dig into the agent. A sample database that contains this agent is attached at the bottom of this article.<\/p>\r\n<p>It essentially begins with the standard stuff I put into any Domino agent:{codecitation class=\"brush:vb; gutter:false\"}Option Public<br \/>Option Declare<br \/>Option Base 1{\/codecitation}<\/p>\r\n<p>Then I define some common variables I’ll need as I process the database view:{codecitation class=\"brush:vb; gutter:false\"}'Notes Objects<br \/>Dim db As NotesDatabase<br \/>Dim doc As NotesDocument<br \/>Dim s As NotesSession<br \/>Dim tmpName As NotesName<br \/>Dim userView As NotesView<br \/>Dim userDoc As NotesDocument<br \/><br \/>'Other variables<br \/>Dim i As Integer<br \/>Dim jsonText As String{\/codecitation}<\/p>\r\n<p>Finally some constants that are used to prepare the JSON text outputted by the agent:{codecitation class=\"brush:vb; gutter:false\"}Const amp = |&amp;|<br \/>Const BR = |&lt;br \/&gt;|<br \/>Const comma = |, |<br \/>Const errorStr = |ERROR: |<br \/>Const quoteStr = |\"|{\/codecitation}<\/p>\r\n<p>It’s the Initialize subroutine where all of the processing happens. Remember, the service works by having essentially a single URL that’s called by the calling program. Parameters passed on the URL instruct the agent what to do. The Initialize subroutine essentially does nothing but parse the URL and call the appropriate subroutine depending on which command (‘list’ or ‘details’) is passed to the agent on the URL.<br \/>Since we’re trying to output JSON in this agent, Initialize begins with a print statement that causes Domino to skip the building of an HTML page to be sent to the calling program. If this wasn’t there, Domino would assume the agent was delivering HTML content and would prepend the beginning parts of a web page to the agent’s output.<\/p>\r\n<p>Next, the agent gets a handle to the current Notes Session object, database object then the agent’s context (through set doc = s.DocumentContext). After that, the agent gets the URL string from the document context and parses it through repeated calls to the GetCmdLineValue function. Once it knows what command has been sent (list or details) and what search string to use, it calls the appropriate subroutine (GetContactList or GetContactDetails) to lookup the appropriate document(s) and output the necessary JSON text.{codecitation class=\"brush:vb; gutter:false\"}Sub Initialize()<br \/><br \/>&nbsp; 'Print out this line to force Domino to not write it's own <br \/>&nbsp; 'HTML gunk at the beginning of the resulting page<br \/>&nbsp; Print \"Content-Type:text\/html\"<br \/> <br \/>&nbsp;

The first article was called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.eview.com\/eview\/volr6.nsf\/2a8bf6b62c61b60585256f2500684630\/20a77ac9fdb52b668525774a00648b3e?OpenDocument\">Mobile Application Development Trends — What Today’s Developer Needs to Know Now <\/a>which was an overview of waht I saw as trends in the mobile development space. It really had nothing to do with Domino development, it was just an analysis of the market. I followed up with two articles about developer's options for mobilizing Domino databases. The first article was called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.eview.com\/eview\/volr6.nsf\/2a8bf6b62c61b60585256f2500684630\/2a1768c092e2a4e1852577ad005735cc?OpenDocument\">Taking It With You, Part 1: Know Your Options for Mobilizing Domino Databases via the Web<\/a> and the second was called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.eview.com\/eview\/volr6.nsf\/2a8bf6b62c61b60585256f2500684630\/364e50adbb7a941d852577b500652df5?OpenDocument\">Taking it With You, Part 2: Mobilizing Domino Databases Using Native Clients, Hybrid Applications, and MEAPs<\/a>. About that time I realized I had a series on my hands and I flushed out all of the articles I wanted to write about mobilizing Domino. Essentially what I did was identify all of the possible options I could think of and planned to write an article about each one of them.<br \/><br \/>The View published the fourth article in the series yesterday, it's called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/gra7bZ\">Mobilizing Domino Data Using Kryos Velocity AppXtender<\/a>. Kryos is about to release (if they haven't already) a pretty cool platform for mobilizing Domino applications called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.kryos.com\/titanweb\/velocity\/velocity-cms.nsf\/0\/D76AA859EB55BF4F872576C50058ACA2?opendocument\">Velocity AppXtender<\/a>; I was invited to participate in the beta program and found the platform to be pretty interesting, complete and well thought out. They'll be making a big splash at Lotusphere 2011 I'm sure, so check them out when you get a chance.<br \/><br \/>In preparation for my session at Lotusphere this year I got to spend some time with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dashcode\">Dashcode<\/a> and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/us.blackberry.com\/developers\/browserdev\/eclipseplugin.jsp\">BlackBerry WebWorks tools<\/a>. Subsequently I wrote articles about each of those tools for the View. They're both written and they're being processed by the very capable editing staff at the View. Next up on my agenda are articles about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.freeyourapps.com\/\">TeamStudio Unplugged<\/a> and Wallace Wireless' <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.wallacewireless.com\/Productsnbspnbsp\/WICDB\/tabid\/98\/Default.aspx\">WIC DB<\/a>. I have the TeamStudio software, I just need to find some time to dig into it. Unfortunately I'm having difficulty getting my hands on the WIC DB product. I spoke with the President of Wallace about a month ago and let him know about the article series. He promised to hook me up with the code, but I've heard nothing from them since then. I followed up via email and received no response. I went to their site today and noticed that they were acquired by Vocera, so perhaps that's why they have become unresponsibe. We'll see what happens, I'll try them again soon. <br \/><br \/>I've also been poking around at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.appcelerator.com\/\">Appcelerator's Titanium<\/a> product. It looks very interesting and, with their acquisition of Aptana this week, makes them a pretty interesting option for mobile development. Unfortunately being a typical open source project (with a paid subscription option) their documentation is non existant. I've been looking at everything I can find on their site and there's nothing there that can help me get started. They have this kitchen sink application that you are supposed to look at to see how to do everything in their platform, but I just can't get the thing to load in the simulator. No usefull error messages or anything, it just won't install in the simulator and I can't figure out why. It's really disappointing me since I really wanted to show my BlackBerry Widget application in Titanium. Hopefully I'll be able to make something happen soon with that.<\/p>\r\n<p>Stay tuned.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"14","created":"2011-01-20 19:52:22","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2011-01-20 19:52:22","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"2","ordering":"79","metakey":"Kryos AppXtender, TeamStudio Unplugged, BlackBerry WebWorks, MEAP","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"7597","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"231","asset_id":"259","title":"First Impressions of Titanium","alias":"first-titanium","introtext":"<p>I've been poking around at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.appcelerator.com\">Appcelerator<\/a> Titanium for the last week or so and I have to admit that I'm really not impressed. It looked like a really interesting solution, but:<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>There's absolutely no documentation - what 'documentation' they do have is nothing more than a sample application called Kitchen Sink that has examples of everything Titanium can do inside of it.<\/li>\r\n<li>It took me hours (and I do mean hours) to get the kitchen sink demo to run in the Android simulator. I followed Einstein's definition of Crazy (doing the same steps over and over again expecting different results) before it finally just worked. There's no docs on how to run it, no instructions, nothing. You can find all sorts of posts on their help area from people who had the same experience I had. I finally found something that explained why it wasn't running. I implemented the fix and still couldn't get it to work. I created several new VM's with clean configs and finally on about the 6th try it finally worked. <\/li>\r\n<li>Screen transitions are slow, applications seem hesitant when running.<\/li>\r\n<li>There's absolutely no layout manager that I can find. When you add objects (such as buttons, fields and so on) to a screen, you have to provide absolute positions for every single element. You can't plunk a label down then add a edit field below it, you have to add both manually, specifying two coordinates (top, left, right, bottom) for each. It absolutely makes no sense that in 2011, with all of these cool smartphones around that you'd have to take that approach to writing applications. <\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p>Granted I'm using the free version, but you'd think there's be something better than this.<\/p>\r\n<p>I LIKE the idea that mobile development in Titanium is all about code - you hand craft code for everything, I truly like that. But to force me to determine EXACTLY where to put things is ridiculous. How do I know where my label is going to end (with word wrap, font size and so on)? Why do I have to manually, physically put every element in its place?<\/p>\r\n<p>It just over complicates applications when you have to code at that level. It's easy for iPhone devices since you only have two real screen resolutions to work with (three if you count the iPad - which you should). But with all the different Android and BlackBerry devices out there, writing specific code for each screen resolution so that screen elements show up where they're supposed to makes no sense.<\/p>\r\n<p>What's surprising as well is how long it's taken them to come out with BlackBerry support. It's been in beta for a very long time - I am curious what's going on with that.<\/p>\r\n<p>I've got to be missing something here. Stay tuned, I'm going to try to build a Titanium version of my contact lookup app and see what I can come up with. I bet I won't be able to do what I want within Titanium.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"14","created":"2011-01-27 00:49:44","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2011-01-27 00:49:44","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"4","ordering":"78","metakey":"Appcelerator, Titanium, Appcelerator Titanium, Android, BlackBerry, iPhone","metadesc":"First impressions of Appcelerator Titanium.

{"id":"233","asset_id":"261","title":"Managing Email Folders & the Grand Mobile Experiment","alias":"managingemailfolders","introtext":"<p>When I first joined AT&amp;T, my boss challenged me to see how long it would take before I switched full time to the Apple iPhone. Once I got settled, I put aside my BlackBerry device and tried to make the switch. My plan was to see if I could use it for two weeks solid; I made it 10 days before I had to switch back to my BlackBerry.<\/p>\r\n<p>It’s not that I’m a BlackBerry bigot, I love technology and playing with different devices. I promise you that if I could find devices that worked the way I needed to work, I’d be happy to switch around between different ones. The problem is that BlackBerry has been optimized for the things I do the most, regular everyday email. Every other platform I’ve used tries, but comes up short in so many ways.<\/p>\r\n<p>Having worked for Research in Motion, I’m a heavy email guy. Because of the instantaneous nature of BlackBerry email, everyone at Research in Motion uses email heavily, even to the point where email was an easier way to reach a colleague than making a phone call. You knew that no matter what the person was doing, especially being on the phone, that they’d be checking their email regularly. Interestingly as these other device platforms (iPhone, Android, Palm and others) try to tackle the enterprise, it’s just not possible for them to accommodate the business email user.<\/p>\r\n<p>What I’ve noticed with these different platforms is that they’re not designed to deal with a user who has a large inbox. On the BlackBerry for example, I can highlight a date, click the menu button and very quickly remove any messages from the device older than the selected date. It doesn’t remove them from your mailbox, just removes them from the device. On the iPhone and Android devices, when you want to clean up your inbox, you have to click each email individually to delete them – that’s ridiculous.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you’re a heavy email user like I am, you probably have hundreds if not thousands of folders in your inbox.&nbsp; When I get an email, I deal with it, delete it if I think I won’t need it anymore and file it if I think I will need it again. On the BlackBerry, I merely press the ‘I’ key on the keyboard and the list of folders appears. If I’d filed a previous message on the same thread, the BlackBerry will automatically highlight the last folder used for messages on that thread. When I select a folder and press the Enter key it’s filed. The whole process takes very little time. Pretty cool.<\/p>\r\n<p>With other device platforms, you have the ability to file messages, but when you activate that function, the complete list of folders displays. There’s no keyboard entry, you have to swipe through every single page of your folder list to get to the one you want. It’s ridiculous. I have hundreds of folders in my inbox, why make me swipe through page after page of folder names to get to the one I want to file my message in? It makes absolutely no sense to me. This is what I mean when I say that most platforms aren’t setup for enterprise email users.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now, you might be saying to yourself “Well, the BlackBerry works that way because it has a keyboard – that’s an easier thing to do with a keyboard.” Unfortunately that’s not the case. Even on a touch screen device, Research in Motion provides you with the means to bring up a keyboard and start typing the name of the folder you want to file your message in. It’s an extra click, but it still allows me to file the message pretty quickly. &nbsp;On iOS and Android, the user is not provided with any means to use the keyboard for folder selection. Apple and Google have decided for you that you’re not allowed to use the on-screen keyboard when filing messages. Makes no sense to me.<\/p>\r\n<p>Why not provide the option to use the keyboard? Default to using your finger to swipe through the folder list, but for people like me who have hundreds of folders, let me select the folder I want to use via the keyboard.&nbsp; These devices are supposed to be so cool and so hot, but something as simple as filing email messages is broken. Like I said at the beginning of this article, these mobile platforms are not designed for the enterprise mail user.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, on to the Big Mobile Experiment… Today I moved my SIM from my BlackBerry Torch 9800 into a Windows Phone 7 device.<\/p>\r\n<p>I was playing last week with the HTC Surround and this week I’m poking around in the LG Quantum. The Surround was pretty cool – I didn’t need the extra weight and thickness provided by the surround speakers, but it was a functional device. I thought I’d like the Quantum because it had a keyboard, but I found that on Windows Phone devices a keyboard is actually a detriment to the end user.&nbsp; I’ve found repeatedly that the UI for many aspects of the phone doesn’t rotate to the keyboard orientation when you slide out the keyboard. If the UI doesn’t switch for keyboard input when you expose the keyboard, what’s the point of having the keyboard?<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, I’m going to use the Quantum as my primary device this week and see how I like it. So far, Windows Phone 7 is better than I expected it to be. I think it has a real chance in the market.<\/p>\r\n<p>Next week I’m going to switch to either the Motorola Bravo or the Motorola Flipside. Those are both Android 2.1 devices, so I’m going to give each a week as my primary device.<\/p>\r\n<p>Following that I should be receiving the Motorola Atrix (which I’m really excited about using) and the HTC Inspire (which is AT&amp;T’s First 4G [marketing 4G, not technology 4G, we’re already there with HSPA+] device). Stay tuned for how it all works out for me.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"15","created":"2011-02-23 19:33:50","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2011-02-23 19:33:50","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"2","ordering":"21","metakey":"BlackBerry, email folder, iPhone, iOS, Android","metadesc":"Most mobile platforms (except BlackBerry) fall short when it comes to simple email folder management.","access":"1","hits":"8805","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

With all of the new devices AT&amp;T has released and finally having some time to play around with them, I’ve been having a blast.I've got 7 devices here on my desk and I'm playing with all of them.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Windows Phone 7<\/h3>\r\n<p>I got a couple of Windows Phone 7 devices before Christmas and I’ve been using them the last week or two (I’ve even taken one of them as my primary device for the week). As I said in my post yesterday, I’ve found that Windows Phone 7 is a much better operating system than I expected. It’s clean, crisp and responsive – I actually like it. Not more than my BlackBerry, but I do like it. It would be very interesting to see what this looked like on a tablet.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Galaxy Tablet<\/h3>\r\n<p>I got a Samsung Galaxy Tablet and I have to say that I truly love it. I know Steve Jobs is poopooing the smaller format, but it’s really, really compelling. The fact that Android is open and I can do essentially anything I want with it (as opposed to what Apple ‘allows’) makes it awesome. The form factor is great – it’s big enough to be really useful, but small enough to be very comfortable in your hand (as opposed to hands). As my wife said this morning “that’s something I could fit in my purse” and that particular though is really more compelling than you’d expect.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Motorola Android Devices<\/h3>\r\n<p>I’m excited about using the Motoroloa Android 2.1 Bravo and Flipside devices. I really expected the Captivate to be the device I could carry full time, but it was so unresponsive most of the time that I just couldn’t use it. We’ll see what the Moto devices feel like.<\/p>\r\n<h3>BlackBerry Playbook<\/h3>\r\n<p>I’m not getting the feeling that the BlackBerry Playbook is going to be a better experience than the Galaxy Tablet. The only thing it has going for it is the tight integration with the BlackBerry device. Since Research in Motion is supposedly planning on a Cellular version of the device (to be released later), I don’t see that feature remaining that compelling. Research in Motion supposedly sees people who don’t currently own a BlackBerry device being interested in the Playbook, but I don’t see it. I can’t imagine someone buying a playbook over the iPad or the Galaxy Tablet unless they are currently a BlackBerry user and want to stay that way. Any other reasons don’t make sense to me.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"15","created":"2011-02-24 14:56:32","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2011-02-24 14:56:32","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"2","ordering":"20","metakey":"BlackBerry Playbook, Windows Phone 7, Samsung Galaxy Tablet, Galaxy Tablet, iPhone","metadesc":"I'm in mobile device heaven this week, playing with all sorts of mobile devices.","access":"1","hits":"8490","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

Essentially it's a web-based web metrics application that you can use to understand a whole bunch of stuff about your site's visitors.<\/p>\r\n<p>I use the service to track visitors to this site and several other sites I maintain, it provides you with a lot of very useful information. I can tell how steady my site's traffic is, where people are visiting from as well as what type of hardware and software visitors are using to access my site. Another interesting feature is traffic sources, I can tell how people are finding my site - which would be very useful information if I were advertising and trying to understand where I should be spending my advertising money.<\/p>\r\n<p>GA tells me which articles are the most popular, allowing me to see trends in readerhip interest. Of course, if I cared about my readers (and I truly do), I could use information about which articles are being read to help guide me on what to write about next. The big question for Domino developers though is how do I effectively use GA to help me track readership in my Domino-based public web site?<\/p>\r\n<p>Lotus Domino web application URL's are...ugly. Lotus has built a great system for managing content on the web, but the behind the scenes URL Domino uses to represent a document in a database doesn't translate very well in GA. You can add analytics to a domino application, but when you look in GA to see which articles are being read, what you'll see is those funky Domino URL's; you won't really be able to tell which documents or views are being opened unless you can translate Domino's internal URL into something more useful.<\/p>\r\n<p>You can easily build your Domino application so all links are more human readable, but when you open a document from a view in a Domino database, the URL reported to GA is the internal one maintained by Domino rather than something human readable. To help Domino developers get around this, I recently published an article in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eview.com\" target=\"_blank\">The View<\/a> called <a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/i6tdsU\" target=\"_blank\">Creating Domino-Friendly Entries in Google Analytics<\/a> that descibes in detail how to use special features of GA to allow a developer to control what URL information is delivered to GA.

Working for a carrier certainly has its benefits and getting one of every new smartphone is one of them. I have been very interested in seeing if I could carry an Android device full time and the Motorola Atrix seems like it could be the device for me.<\/p>\r\n<p>I’m not abandoning the BlackBerry platform, but Android is…cooler and I don’t have someone like Steve Jobs deciding what I can and cannot do on my mobile phone.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, some initial observations about the Atrix:<\/p>\r\n<p>First of all, it’s FAST. One of the problems I had with the Samsung Captivate and other Android devices was that they’re often unresponsive. When I would turn on a device and try to type in my password to unlock the device, it would often not be able to keep up with my key presses. Ugh.<\/p>\r\n<p>I really miss the BlackBerry platform’s ability to set a system wide font. As I get older, I am having a harder and harder time reading smartphone screens without my glasses on. On the BlackBerry, I can define system wide font settings and make the screen more readable for me in many applications, but Android doesn’t have anything like that. I’m pretty sure I won’t be able to use this device everywhere simply for the reason that I won’t be able to read it without my glasses and I don’t bring them with me everywhere.<\/p>\r\n<p>I’m not a fan of Moto Blur (or anything like that added by device manufacturers). Why can’t I just have Android as Android? Why do I need the extra UI and applications layers that Blur and the other systems add? Makes no sense to me – get out of my way.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Atrix has three email clients and they each work differently. Ugh! Why does there need to be three of them? The BlackBerry has one, so I can do the same things in different email accounts. The Gmail messaging client allows you to control what happens when you delete an email – you can go back to the message list or an older or newer message in the message list. I like that feature. The corporate and personal email clients? No such thing. For some ridiculous reason when you open a message then delete it, you’re taken back to the message list and have no configuration options that can change that behavior. Ugh! When I open a message and delete it, I want the messaging application to open the next message in the message list. Making me go back to the message list and select another message to open adds clicks to my experience and makes it take longer to get through my inbox.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"15","created":"2011-04-13 17:44:03","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2011-04-13 17:44:03","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"1","ordering":"19","metakey":"motorola atrix","metadesc":"An analysis of my first experiences with the Motorola Atrix.","access":"1","hits":"8291","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"241","asset_id":"269","title":"What Were they Thinking #8","alias":"wwtt8","introtext":"<p>I’m at the BlackBerry World conference this week and I thought it was a good time to add an article to the What Were They Thinking series. The example for this article is the conference application for the BlackBerry World conference in Orlando. RIM has hired different developer organizations to create the different applications, there was the Sweet Ceasar applications commissioned for the BlackBerry Developer conference which used so many fancy screen effects that the application was unusable. What happens is RIM is trying to demonstrate how cool applications can be on the BlackBerry platform and encourage these developers to do all sorts of fancy things to highlight that. Unfortunately what you end up getting is something unusable and this year’s BlackBerry World Conference application is no exception. When you focus on flash rather than functionality, the end user suffers.<\/p>\r\n<p>Take a look at the following screen shot; you’ll see the warning that it will take from 2 to 3 minutes to load the data for the application. Unfortunately, this delay (and the corresponding warning) happens every single time you load the application (yep, every single time). I don’t know about you, but no mobile application should take 2 to 3 minutes to start up; that’s completely unacceptable.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/bb_app_world_app_1.jpg\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1 – BlackBerry World Conference Application Startup Screen<\/p>\r\n<p>Why do that? Why not cache some or all of the data? This approach essentially makes this application unusable. I expect that there’s an expectation that you’ll leave the application running during the day, but I don’t use mobile applications that way. I use the application then escape out so I can recover some memory and not have a bunch of applications running in the background all the time. Steve Job’s approach is to deny you an Escape button, so every application suspends when backgrounded, but it’s much better (for me anyway) to just let me decide what happens.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>What a developer should have done is preload the application with a default set of options then display an application’s main screen and load additional data in the background.&nbsp; Let me at least work with some non-dynamic data or the data from a previous load instead of making me wait for a data load every single time the application launches.<\/p>\r\n<p>Somebody wasn’t thinking.<\/p>\r\n<p>Another thing I noticed was that there is no provision for me (or at least I can’t seem to find it) to be able to add items from my schedule to my calendar. Previous year’s application allowed that, but this year’s doesn’t. That doesn’t make sense to me since RIM has made such a big push for Super Apps. Super Apps are supposed to be all about integration with other applications and activities on the device, what I can’t understand then is why I can’t register for a session at the conference and immediately add it to my BlackBerry calendar.<\/p>\r\n<p>What I have to do instead is open the conference app every time I want to see what my event schedule is. Since that takes 2 to 3 minutes, that makes it a tough thing to do when trying to rush from session to session.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Somebody wasn’t thinking.<\/p>\r\n<p>One good thing I saw was that the developer coded the application so the ‘my schedule’ portion of the app doesn’t show days where you don’t have sessions scheduled. If you take a look at Figure 2, you’ll see that it’s not showing events for Thursday because I don’t have anything scheduled for that day. That’s good attention to detail.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/bb_app_world_app_2.jpg\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2 – My Schedule<\/p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, what they did with this option is the same thing that other vendors have done with other conference apps. When I open the application on Tuesday for example, it should automatically highlight the current day in the schedule. Instead, I have to click on a day or scroll down to a day and press return. If they’d thought about the use cases, they would have realized that if I’m looking at the schedule, there’s a high likelihood that I care most about the current day’s schedule before any other option.&nbsp; Don’t force me to pick the day every single time I look at the schedule when you know that today’s what I’m most likely to need.<\/p>\r\n<p>What I would have done is opened the current day’s schedule automatically (why make me click?), then give users the ability to easily pick another day of the conference. It’s only a three (or four day depending on how you look at it), how hard would it be to implement a more efficient way to look at my schedule?<\/p>\r\n<p>Companies need to focus on usability before anything else.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"14","created":"2011-05-04 14:00:00","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2011-05-04 14:00:00","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"5","ordering":"77","metakey":"BlackBerry World, BlackBerry World Conference application, RIM, BlackBerry","metadesc":"What were they thinking #8: The BlackBerry App World Conference Application.","access":"1","hits":"8054","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"242","asset_id":"270","title":"Multiple-login Smartphones","alias":"mls","introtext":"<p>Why can’t you login to your smartphone? You can password protect them (either set by the user or required by an enterprise administrator), but why can’t you log into them?<\/p>\r\n<p>I got started in the mobile apps world many years ago. RIM hired me to be a mobile apps evangelist for AT&amp;T’s customers. I worked with mobile apps at BoxTone and in my current role at AT&amp;T I work with mobile application platforms that allow organizations to build one application that runs natively on multiple mobile device platforms. Over the years, the whole mobile apps story got easier and easier – organizations were getting over their concerns about mobile apps and actually starting to do something interesting with them.<\/p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately now that Enterprises have to deal with the iPhone and Android platforms, many organizations have essentially put the kibosh on applications initiatives while they figure out the whole mobile device management (MDM) thing.<\/p>\r\n<p>I’ve been in meetings and conference sessions lately that deal with device management and it’s clearly something that organizations are struggling with. BlackBerry shops have it easy since the BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) takes care of so many of the things IT and Security departments require, but with today’s proliferation of device types, the BES isn’t enough. With this week’s announcement of RIM’s acquisition of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ubitexx.com\" target=\"_blank\">Ubitexx<\/a>, it’s possible that RIM can solve this problem – who knows.<\/p>\r\n<p>What’s interesting though is how the ultimate solution to most organization’s mobile device management problems is clearly known, but it’s impossible for third party software developers (such as the market’s MDM providers) to implement. The ultimate solution has to be a core part of the device operating system, not an add-on that has to work around existing API’s and device limitations. What smartphone manufacturers have to do is provide the means for the smartphone users to have the ability to define distinct logins for multiple users on the device.<\/p>\r\n<p>For the enterprise, an enterprise aware smartphone would have the means to allow the user to have a personal login (with access to all of your personal data and accounts) and another separate corporate login with access to work-specific information (data, applications and accounts).&nbsp; As the user logs into either account, he or she is exposed to only the data that’s associated with the account. This makes perfect sense – give me complete separation between my work and personal activities and most of the enterprise’s concerns go away.<\/p>\r\n<p>The phone would have to support managing multiple phone numbers, but that technology exists already today. The user would have their personal phone number associated with one account and a work mobile number or a work mobile and office numbers associated with the enterprise login. When the phone rings, the device would have to be able to switch on the fly to the personality associated with the phone number that’s ringing or at least be able to access the caller ID information (from the address book) stored&nbsp; with the account associated with the phone number so it can be displayed to the user.<\/p>\r\n<p>Common applications (such as email, calendar, contacts and more) can be shared across multiple logins, but individual custom apps could be installed in a private memory area. There would be no common data shared between logins though except perhaps log files.<\/p>\r\n<p>The same feature can be used to make tablets more useful as well. It makes no sense for consumers why tablet manufacturers don’t allow devices to have multiple accounts. Any family with an Android tablet should be able to define multiple accounts and easily switch between them. That way, I can setup my preferences and account information (mail, facebook, linkedin and more) and when my wife or one of my children logs into the device they see their individual settings instead of mine. Why isn’t that possible?<\/p>\r\n<p>Clearly it’s a direct decision made by device manufacturers – these tablets are so popular and sexy, but limiting this capability forces people to buy more tablets. I have one, my wife would have one and each child would need one too. Implementing multiple logins, while completely possible, would result in reduced sales for the device manufacturers. That’s ultimately what’s keeping manufacturers from implementing this in my opinion.<\/p>\r\n<p>What would have to change in order to support this feature I’m describing? Well, devices would need more memory; I’m guessing twice as much. There wouldn’t need to be changes in the processing power and battery for the device, it’s still doing the same amount of work. I imagine when you login to a second account, the applications being executed under the first login would need to be suspended or terminated. Everything else stays the same, right?<\/p>\r\n<p>Carriers benefit since the device will be provisioned with multiple mobile numbers, so there’s increased revenue for the carriers.<\/p>\r\n<p>Let’s start lobbying the device manufacturers for this capability. It makes so much more sense than what we have today. I’d love to be able to share an iPad with my wife and family.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"15","created":"2011-05-05 11:58:04","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2011-05-05 12:00:00","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"3","ordering":"18","metakey":"MDM, login to your smartphone","metadesc":"Why don't mobile devices support multiple logins?","access":"1","hits":"10447","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"243","asset_id":"271","title":"What Were they Thinking #8 – Part 2","alias":"wwtt8-2","introtext":"<p>A few hours after posting my article about the BlackBerry World conference application, RIM released an update to the program. I can’t imagine what change would be so important to release an update to the application in the middle of a four day conference, but they did. Must have been a bug.<\/p>\r\n<p>When I opened the application the first couple of times after installing the update, instead of the default ‘please wait 2-3 minutes while the application loads’ that I complained so much about, the application showed a blank screen (with a web browser cursor for some bizarre reason) for a really long time before opening. I imagine that it was somehow updating the existing data in the application or upgrading a local database, but it took a really long time without any indication on the screen what was happening. I even pulled the battery and tried again to see if I was having a problem with my device.<\/p>\r\n<p>That’s not good programming.<\/p>\r\n<p>One of the things I noticed as I worked with the application was that the developer didn’t make any accommodation for changing the orientation of the device. I use a BlackBerry Torch 9800, from AT&amp;T of course, and it has a touch screen and slide out keyboard. I can change the orientation of the device and get better screen real estate for the browser and some applications.&nbsp; When you look at the application in portrait mode, you’ll see something similar to what’s shown in Figure 1.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2011\/bb_app_world_app_3.jpg\" \/><br \/>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>When you switch the device to landscape orientation, you’ll see a screen similar to the one shown in Figure 2.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2011\/bb_app_world_app_4.jpg\" \/><br \/>Figure 2<\/p>\r\n<p>Notice that the screen doesn’t orient itself to make full use of the screen real estate available when the device is in landscape orientation. This makes no sense to me. BlackBerry Device Software has API’s that allow the developer to react to orientation changes since BlackBerry Device Software 4.7. These API’s allow a developer to adjust the layout of their application’s screens when the user rotates the device. The application clearly adjusts the header so it looks correct in this orientation, but why didn’t they make it so the home screen options adjust their layout as well?&nbsp; What’s the sense in making me scroll down to access the third row of icons when I have the room to fit at least two of them in that blank space to the right.<\/p>\r\n<p>It’s just sloppy programming – how could this have been missed? Did they expect that the user would never turn their BlackBerry touch-screen devices on their side?<\/p>\r\n<p>Notice too that in Figure 2 you can see the pointer (the arrow cursor) on the screen. It’s a touch screen device, why show non-touch screen controls when running on a touch screen device? Another example of sloppy programming. When touch is not available, that’s a useful navigational element. On touch screens, in this case I’ve touched between icons to bring up the cursor, it’s not needed. There’s no need to show the cursor when I’ve touched the screen, I can’t use my finger to move the cursor (not that I’d want to), so it should be turned off when running on this device.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>It’s RIM’s app, they released it in support of their premier customer conference. They’re spending a lot of time and money promoting their concept of Super Apps http:\/\/us.blackberry.com\/developers\/started\/super_apps.jsp but when they release an app for their conference, the hire a developer that can’t make accommodation for orientation changes or integration with the device calendar?&nbsp; That’s sloppy, very sloppy.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"14","created":"2011-05-06 12:30:21","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2011-05-06 12:30:21","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"1","ordering":"76","metakey":"BlackBerry World, BlackBerry World Conference application, orientation","metadesc":"More issues with the BlackBerry World conference application","access":"1","hits":"22097","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

MEAP is a term I believe was coined by Gartner a few years back and since it’s their term, their publications on MEAP are the industry’s reference on the topic.<\/p>\r\n<p>In December, 2009 Gartner published a MEAP Magic Quadrant document that talked about the different MEAP vendors, their capabilities and how they were faring in the market. It wasn’t until April, 2011 that the next edition of that publication was published and it contained some interesting information.<\/p>\r\n<p>First of all, for those of you who understand Garter’s Magic Quadrants, any vendor wants to be in the upper right corner of the quadrant. That’s the place for the movers and shakers, the innovators and the ones to watch. For this year’s MEAP Magic Quadrant, the upper right corner is empty.&nbsp; Yep, empty. None of the MEAP vendors are perceived by Gartner to be leaders in the space. I thought that was weird. How can you have 10 or so vendors and none of them being leaders?<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, the thing that caught my attention was how out of touch Gartner is about what RIM is doing in the market. In the 2011 MEAP Magic Quadrant document (<em>Magic Quadrant for Mobile Enterprise Application Platforms<\/em>) and another document I just read this morning called <em>Critical Capabilities for Mobile Enterprise Application Platforms<\/em> (ID #G00212257) Gartner refers to the RIM MDS Runtime client and development tools. The interesting thing about that is that RIM discontinued the MDS Runtime development tools and runtime client in December 2009. So in this case, Gartner is making statements and assessing RIM’s capabilities using products that RIM discontinued about 18 months ago.<\/p>\r\n<p>How can Gartner be effective and accurate if they base their analysis on products that are no longer even produced or supported by the vendors? That makes no sense to me. The MDS Runtime tools were great and I am disappointed that they’re no longer available, but they’re gone now – never to return.

{"id":"246","asset_id":"274","title":"Going Cross Platform","alias":"going-cross-platform","introtext":"<p>I came across an article in APC Magazine this week that discusses problems developers have with cross platform mobile development. The article is called <a href=\"http:\/\/apcmag.com\/smartphone-development-going-cross-platform.htm\" target=\"_self\">Smartphone Devlopment: Going Cross Platform<\/a> and what interested me was what was being said about iPhone development.<\/p>\r\n<p>There’s this perception in the market that since the iPhone platform is so cool and the apps are so beautiful, that it must be easy to develop for the platform. There’s so much bias out there in favor of the iPhone that it is hard to get an honest assessment without appearing bigoted against iPhone.&nbsp; I did some iPhone development in preparation for a conference presentation last year and even though I had more than 20 years of experience as a professional software developer, the development approach to iPhone development and the archaic Objective-C were so hard to work with that I wasn’t able to finish the application in time for the conference session. I worked on it for weeks and weeks and had to give up because it was just incomprehensible to me.<\/p>\r\n<p>Apple Macintosh and iPhone development is done using technologies Apple obtained when it purchased NextStep back in the 80’s. Objects such as strings start with NS, NextStep, so instead of working with Strings, you have to work with NSStrings. Why they can’t be just strings makes no sense to me, but that’s the way it is. The iPhone platform has no garbage collection capabilities – developers have to track everything and make sure memory is freed up when an object is no longer used. Everything is a pointer; there’s no direct access to variables, it’s all pointers to variables. It’s very 1980’s.<\/p>\r\n<p>I laugh when I hear people complain that the BlackBerry development stuff is ‘old’ – I’m old enough to know that the iPhone stuff is even older. Most modern languages have some sort of garbage collection mechanism. BlackBerry and Android have it because of their use of Java. Not true in iPhone development – you have to do the work yourself.&nbsp; Ugh!<\/p>\r\n<p>Let’s take a look at some important tidbits from the article:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“Going to iPhone development feels like a backwards step from programming in managed environments like Java and .NET, where memory management, exception handling and the like are automatic,”&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“The iPhone stuff is still in the dark ages in terms of programming environments: you’ve got to keep track of everything,” he continues. “Objective C tries to make sure everybody understands who’s responsible for freeing up what, but it feels like going backwards; being able to have Java-like memory management makes a big difference for developers.”<\/p>\r\n<p>In a rapidly-growing market where iPhone support is the de rigeur standard for developers and a necessary step to access the world’s largest and most successful App Store, Powell’s comments may sound like heresy. But with Android having rapidly emerged as a viable alternative over the past year, it reflects the growing realisation among many developers that iOS is no longer the be-all and end-all of mobile operating systems.<\/p>\r\n<p>Needing to build and maintain two or more versions of a smartphone app raises the difficulty level of many development projects significantly, particularly for small developers. “iOS and Android are very different platforms,\" says Bradby. \"Someone who's skilled in Java say, doing Android, is not necessarily and unlikely to understand the Objective C and XCode development environment for iOS. Having a team of developers that can maintain both of those code bases is difficult; there’s no way we can do native development on more than two platforms.”<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"14","created":"2011-05-13 17:27:14","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2011-05-13 17:27:14","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"3","ordering":"74","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"8054","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

There was Craig Johnston’s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0764589539\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mcnsof-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0764589539\" target=\"_blank\">Professional BlackBerry<\/a> that was supposed to be a ‘Programmer to Programmer™’ book but ultimately had very little to do with BlackBerry development (except for some simple chapters on BlackBerry browser development and Push). Beginning in November, the first real BlackBerry development books were released (including mine) and the options a new BlackBerry developer had at his disposal increased dramatically.<\/p>\r\n<p>One of the first books out of the gate was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1430272252\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mcnsof-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=1430272252\" target=\"_blank\">Beginning BlackBerry Development<\/a> by Anthony Rizk (Apress ISBN: 978-1-4302-7225-0). The author was one of the founders of the long time BlackBerry ISV Alliance Partner Rove Mobile (formerly Idokorro) and recently started a software company called Zeebu Mobile which produces entertainment applications for children that run on BlackBerry smartphones. He’s been developing BlackBerry applications since the very early days and clearly has the background needed to get you up and running quickly.<\/p>\r\n<p>The first thing to know about this book is that it’s not really about beginning BlackBerry development. It’s actually about beginning BlackBerry Java development. If you’re looking for a book to help you get started with all aspects of BlackBerry development, you’re looking at the wrong book. This book is for Java developers getting into mobile development on the BlackBerry platform and for that audience the book performs well. I spoke with Anthony about the title before it was published and he indicated that the book was one of a series of Beginning X Development topics from Apress and he couldn’t change the title to more accurately address it’s audience.<\/p>\r\n<p>It’s not a long book; it weighs in at 238 pages and doesn’t dig too deeply into highly technical topics. It starts with the basics then holds your hand through enhancing your application’s user interface (UI) and adding common features needed by most BlackBerry Java applications (such as networking, location-based services and storing application data). The topics are covered in a clear and easy to understand manner and Anthony provided just the right topics for this entry level book.<\/p>\r\n<p>Let’s dig into the content.<\/p>\r\n<p>The book begins with the requisite introduction to the BlackBerry platform and the BlackBerry development tools. The overview is very high level, but if you’re an experienced developer, it’s probably all you need to get started. If you’re an Enterprise developer and need to know more about what the BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) and BlackBerry Mobile Data System (MDS) do for you and your application, you won’t find detailed information here. Since it’s really a book for Java developers, and most likely targeted at developers of consumer applications, those details really aren’t going to be missed.<\/p>\r\n<p>Chapter 2 jumps into the standard Hello World application and uses the topic to help introduce you the ins and outs of the BlackBerry Java development environments (for those that don’t know, the BlackBerry platform sports its own, free Java Development Environment [JDE] plus a more user friendly Eclipse plug-in). After you’ve built the application, your taken on a tour of the debugging capabilities of the platform’s tools and educated on some topics that are often overlooked such as adding an icon to your application, setting the application’s title, signing the application, testing on a device or a device simulator &amp; more.<\/p>\r\n<p>Chapter 3 digs into the aspects of a BlackBerry Java application that makes it a BlackBerry application. It covers the BlackBerry event and thread models and how a developer needs to write her code to play nice on the device.&nbsp; It includes coverage on how to update the UI from other threads and how to create libraries and use alternate entry points in your BlackBerry application to provide additional functionality for your users. The topics covered in this chapter are very important to the new BlackBerry Java developer and they’re covered with just the right amount of depth to get you started recognizing that you’ll use the BlackBerry API JavaDocs to dig into more of the details.<\/p>\r\n<p>The next couple of chapters help you take a simple BlackBerry application and build a more compelling user interface for the application. The BlackBerry UI libraries, while very capable, just aren’t generally used out of the box to create beautiful application interfaces. For someone like me, who’s not a heavy duty Java developer, the topics covered in these chapters were just what I needed to understand how I can extend the base BlackBerry UI classes to create a pleasant look for any application. It shows you how to do some simple enhancements to enhance the look without doing any crazy, processor hogging and battery draining special effects.<\/p>\r\n<p>The remaining chapters of the book cover in just the right detail the different options available to a BlackBerry Java developer to store application data locally (including the standard JME mechanisms, BlackBerry-specific capabilities, SQLite and writing directly to the file system), using the networking API’s to send data to and receive data from a server, using GPS to build location aware applications plus packaging and deploying applications (including commercial distribution through the BlackBerry App World).<\/p>\r\n<p>In all, it’s well structured introduction to BlackBerry Java development. It’s clear that the book was rushed out to publication, there are some typos and formatting problems with the text, but that shouldn’t detract from the content.

{"id":"252","asset_id":"280","title":"Review of Advanced BlackBerry Development","alias":"review-of-advanced-blackberry-development","introtext":"<p>Here's a review I wrote more than a year ago for Chris King's Advanced BlackBerry Development:<\/p>\r\n<p>Joining the flurry of BlackBerry books released within the last year is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1430226560\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mcnsof-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=1430226560\" target=\"_blank\">Advanced BlackBerry Development<\/a> by Chris King (Apress ISBN: 978-1-4302-2656-7). Marketed as a sort of sequel to Anthony Rizk’s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1430272252\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mcnsof-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=1430272252\" target=\"_blank\">Beginning BlackBerry Development<\/a>, the book is supposed to kick it up a notch and dig into some of the more complicated things you can do with the BlackBerry Java platform. What you’ll find though is that the book should actually be entitled “Mobile Java Development Including BlackBerry” – I’ll try to explain below.<\/p>\r\n<p>One of the things I’ve noticed lately as I read mobile development forums and the groups on LinkedIn is that when developers talk about mobile development, they usually generalize their comments and don’t identify which area of development they’re talking about: enterprise or consumer mobile application development. They both have very different needs, requirements and issues and effect how you look at a particular problem. Since I come from an enterprise development background, when I look at the title of this book, I expect to see advanced topics covered such as getting data from back-end data sources (especially connecting to XML-based and RESTful web services), dealing with encryption and security issues, plus managing the availability of different network connections. When looking at the topics covered in this book, it’s clear that the author is looking at the topic from the consumer side of mobile development – he gives some cursory coverage to the BlackBerry development tools, connecting to files and networks then jumps into a consumer oriented media grabber application that pulls media files down from web sites. While the book does address more advanced enterprise-related topics such as integration with device-side applications and security, these types of topics take a back seat to topics such as playing and recording media files and sending or receiving text messages. There’s nothing wrong with this approach, it just splits the potential audience for the book.<\/p>\r\n<p>In digging through the chapters, the author does a really good job of digging deep into the major topic areas he’s selected for the book. The book is broken up into three parts and each part covers a different area of BlackBerry Java development. Part 1 deals with what the author calls Advanced API’s, part 2 deals with device integration and the last part deals with security and more developer oriented topics (as opposed to development-related topics).<\/p>\r\n<p>In the advanced API’s part of the book, the author describes in great detail how to capture media files (pictures and video), playback media files (audio and video playback), send and receive SMS, MMS and email messages plus use available encryption API’s to encrypt data. For each of these topics, the author does a great job of explaining most available options and provides a wealth of source code that illustrates points made therein. What I found interesting though, was that as the author tackled a topic, in many cases he covered (in great detail) non-BlackBerry ways to address a problem before explaining the BlackBerry way of doing things. This is why I suggested the title change at the beginning of this review. What this book should cover is BlackBerry topics only – leave the other topics to any of the already existing JME books available to developers. The approach the author took here makes me feel that his target audience isn’t BlackBerry developers, but JME developers who work with multiple platforms and are adding BlackBerry to their mix. Again, there’s nothing wrong with this approach, it just isn’t what I expected from an advanced BlackBerry book.<\/p>\r\n<p>Even the topic of cryptography is covered with a cross platform bias. Considering that the BlackBerry is the most secure mobile platform on the market, the author covers the open source Bouncy Castle cryptography API’s before digging into the robust BlackBerry security API’s and, recent purchase, the Certicom cryptography API’s.<\/p>\r\n<p>In the second part of the book, covering device integration, contains the most detailed description of how to integrate with the Personal Information Management (PIM) capabilities of the BlackBerry platform that I’ve ever come across. The material includes a detailed description of how it works plus a lot of source code to help you integrate the concepts into your applications. RIM provides some information on the topic in its API documentation, developer web site and sample applications, but this is complete coverage of the topic and very useful.<\/p>\r\n<p>The next chapter digs into several aspects of the BlackBerry browser. It covers topics related to the different types of browsers and markup languages, then shows you how to launch the browser from your application and embed the browser in your own applications (none of which are really advanced topics). The chapter finally enters the advanced realm at the end with its coverage of how to create and install a plug-in for rendering custom content in the browser. This is a topic I have never seen described anywhere else and I actually didn’t know this was available in the BlackBerry browser until now. It’s a cool feature and I’m not sure how many BlackBerry developers really need to do this, but it’s sure nice to have the information at your fingertips.<\/p>\r\n<p>The last chapter in this part of the book contains a sort of strange hodgepodge of topics that really don’t seem to go together but needed to find some place in the book. The chapter begins with a very detailed coverage of how to use the Content Handler API (CHAPI, JSR 211) to allow your application to seamlessly communicate with other applications running on the device in a secure and manageable manner. This is another one of those advanced topics that really isn’t covered well anywhere else. It’s clear that the author has spent a fair amount of time working with these API’s in his applications and the reader can really benefit from his experience here.<\/p>\r\n<p>The chapter next digs into the options related to application icons. It provides basic information about application icons then covers very thoroughly how to manipulate an application’s icon from within a Java application. I’m really not sure why this topic is in this chapter; it needed to be somewhere in the book and the topic is covered well, I’m just not sure why it ended up where it did.<\/p>\r\n<p>Finally the chapter ends with detailed coverage of the options a developer has for manipulating the menu available to BlackBerry applications. Most BlackBerry Java developers quickly learn how to add menu items to their applications, but where things get more interesting is when you can expose features of your application through a custom menu item in another application. This comes in handy for example when you want to act on information contained in the Contacts application. Just add a menu item in Contacts that allows the user to pass data from a selected contact to your application. It’s this type of seamless integration that really makes a BlackBerry application shine.<\/p>\r\n<p>The last part of the book provides the necessary coverage of BlackBerry application security. No advanced BlackBerry book would be complete without coverage of the topic. It then jumps into topics related to developing for multiple versions of the BlackBerry Device Software (an issue any BlackBerry developer has to deal with unless they work in a very controlled environment). Because the BlackBerry platform has been around for a very long time and has supported many different wireless networks, device form factors, screen sizes and keyboard layouts, there’s a lot a developer must to do to ensure their application will work on any BlackBerry device. The book does a pretty good job of covering the right topics, but the author refers to issues related to writing applications for different BlackBerry OS versions when that’s not how it works. The BlackBerry OS running on the device is the underlying software (kernel, hardware libraries and so on) that makes the device work – it’s the BlackBerry Device Software running on top of it that provides the UI and the features an application interacts with. Throughout the book, the author incorrectly refers to the OS when he really meant the BlackBerry Device Software.<\/p>\r\n<p>This last part of the book wraps up with coverage of how to setup an automated build process for your applications. As you build more and more applications, especially if you have to support multiple BlackBerry Device Software versions with your applications, having an automated build process makes life much easier and it’s nice to see it covered in the book.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>There were some serious problems with the book that I think are important to point out. I found myself writing ‘wrong’, ‘huh?’, ‘why?’ and ‘which ones?’ a lot in the margins of the book as I read through it. Let me explain:<\/p>\r\n<p>The author clearly wanted to cover certain topics in detail but knew at the same time that he had to provide some background information to make the book complete. I really felt like he hurried through many of the more introductory topics in order to provide the needed coverage but was eager to get into the other stuff he wanted to cover. Selecting the right version of the BlackBerry development tools to use based upon the devices that will be using your application is a very important and is the most common thing missed by a developer when getting started. In the section of the book that dealt with this topic, there was only a cursory explanation and the importance of this really wasn’t stressed.<\/p>\r\n<p>I found that there were quite a few places in the book where the information the author provided was just wrong. It was clear that he regularly encountered things with the BlackBerry development tools that didn’t work or didn’t work like he expected and, rather than try to find out what’s really going on, he just assumed it was a problem, wrote about it in the book and moved on. Very early in the book, on page 5 actually, he indicated that there was a bug in the Eclipse plug-in that prohibited you from having more than one project in an Eclipse workspace. This just isn’t true – it’s not how Eclipse works and it’s definitely not how the BlackBerry plug-in for Eclipse works. It may have been something he encountered with an early beta build of the tool, but a blanket statement like that did not belong in the book. For the entire remainder of the manuscript he created a new workspace before creating any new project and that’s just not the way it works. I have several BlackBerry workspaces in Eclipse and every one of them have multiple BlackBerry projects and it works very well.<\/p>\r\n<p>The author clearly has a lot of experience working with the BlackBerry platform and through this has uncovered many places where things often don’t work as expected. It’s one of the reasons why people would purchase a book like this – to find out things that aren’t easily covered in the documentation and things that need to be avoided. The problem is that, although the author identified these types of issues in many places throughout the book, in every case he would omit listing the specific device models affected by an issue. He would identify the problem with a blanket statement such as ‘this doesn’t work on several BlackBerry models because of…’ but never actually identifies the models. This is partially useful information – I now know that the issue exists, but I have to look elsewhere to determine whether it affects a device I’m targeting for my application. Having to put down a book and fire up a browser search engine to find out the specific details behind an important topic is not what I expected from a book like this, especially due to the great level of detail included for so many other topics.<\/p>\r\n<p>As you can probably see, I’m a little lukewarm on the book.&nbsp; It’s great if you are building BlackBerry Java applications and need information on the specific topics covered here – the author did a very good job of covering most of the selected topics in a very detailed manner (very appropriate coverage for an advanced level book). I find though that the book falls down in several areas. I would have liked to see more detailed coverage of how to deal with the different networks available to modern BlackBerry devices and strategies for communicating with back-end data sources but as I mentioned, it’s mostly a consumer oriented book and those topics aren’t as important to consumer application developers. Most of all, I wish the author wasn’t in such a rush to get to the topics he found more interesting and instead gave equal level of coverage to all included topics.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"2","created":"2011-06-21 15:00:00","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2016-04-13 00:19:11","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2011-06-21 15:00:00","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"5","ordering":"18","metakey":"Advanced BlackBerry Development","metadesc":"A review I wrote more than a year ago for Chris King's Advanced BlackBerry Development.","access":"1","hits":"7987","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

{"id":"256","asset_id":"284","title":"Concrete5","alias":"concrete5","introtext":"<p>A while back I got really interested in content management systems (CMS). When I discovered Joomla!, I quickly created this site and hundreds of articles later it’s still going strong. A few years ago, Wired Magazine (I think it was Wired) did an article about an open source CMS called Concrete5 (www.concrete5.org) and it looked…interesting. I installed a copy of it, but never really got the hang of it. I didn’t have a site I wanted to build at the time, so I didn’t really have a reason to use it and that probably affected my experience with the product. Ultimately though, I think I really didn’t understand what it was. I was used to Joomla! and Drupal and expected Concrete5 to be like those other CMS’s. It’s not really, where normal CMS’s are database &amp; template driven systems for displaying content, Concrete5 is more of a web site builder that uses a database in the back-end to store the content. It’s for building sites with pages rather than creating articles, links and other things that are rendered by the CMS templates.<\/p>\r\n<p>I decided a few weeks ago to build the John Wargo Books site (www.johnwargobooks.com) and thought doing the site using Concrete5 would be fun. I quickly registered the domain, downloaded the files and got started. Knowing now that I was working with a site builder, it was really easy to populate the home page with the content I wanted (shown in Figure 1).<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2011\/jmwb1.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>Once I had that done, all I had to do was add a navigational component (shown in orange on the right side of Figure 1) then create the additional ‘pages’ I needed for my site.<\/p>\r\n<p>The cool thing about this tool is that your site building is all done in the browser. When you access the home page, you can easily login (the default Concrete5 template includes a login link in the footer, the template I’m using now does not) and directly manipulate the site using buttons that appear at the top of the page (as shown in Figure 2).<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2011\/jmwb2.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2<\/p>\r\n<p>To edit a page, you navigate to the page then click the ‘Edit page’ button.

The system allows you to define a hierarchy for your pages then the navigational component automatically reflects your changes. There’s plug-ins such as the ‘Share’ button and the site search shown in Figure 1. Behind the scenes there’s a Dashboard view (shown in Figure 3) that allows you to configure the site as a whole.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2011\/jmwb3.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 3<\/p>\r\n<p>In all, it’s a pretty easy system to setup and use.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"8","created":"2011-06-28 12:01:32","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2011-06-28 12:01:32","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"2","ordering":"11","metakey":"John Wargo Books, Concrete5, Content Management System","metadesc":"Started using Concrete5 to manage one of my sites","access":"1","hits":"9661","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

It’s an interesting read and it had to be said. It’s really sad, but RIM has been slow in its response to market changes and it’s likely that they won’t be able to recover.<\/p>\r\n<p>Their development tools are sub-par and it takes a ridiculous amount of time to release them. Where Apple and Android pre-release their development tools or at least ship them on the same day the device is announced, RIM does prolonged betas and in one case delivered the SDK out of beta only after a device that used the particular SDK had been in market for almost 6 months. Ridiculous.<\/p>\r\n<p>I was trying to get my demo machine ready for a presentation at The View Developer Conference last week and had upgraded one of my BlackBerry Java projects that I was going to show at the conference. When I loaded the project, Eclipse gave me all sorts of errors that I just couldn’t resolve. I quickly called a former colleague at RIM and he informed me that he never imports old projects into Eclipse; he created a new project every time and copied his code over into the project.&nbsp; Ugh! Is that world class development? No ! Is it at least acceptable? No way!<\/p>\r\n<p>Is Apple’s Platform better? No, absolutely not. I wrote about this a few weeks ago, but developing for the iPhone is much, much harder than it is for any other mobile platform I’ve worked with (I’ve worked with a lot). In <a href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=246:going-cross-platform&amp;catid=14&amp;Itemid=22\">a previous article on this site<\/a>, I referred to a post by an Australian developer who confirmed my conclusion.<\/p>\r\n<p>RIM gets hammered because its technology is so old, but the iOS tools are even older. BlackBerry development’s primary language is Java which was released in 1995. NextStep, the stuff that Objective-C (and all iOS development) is based on was released in 1989. iOS has no Garbage collection capabilities, the developer has to manage the lifecycle of all objects – there’s not another popular smartphone platform in market that has that same limitation. In Objective-C, all references to variables are through pointers – that’s so 1980’s (or so Pascal), the development world is way past that approach. Compared to every other modern development language, Objective-C code has so many quirks that it’s essentially unreadable (to me anyway – and I’ve been a professional developer for almost 30 years).<\/p>\r\n<p>If you’re a new developer, Objective-C might make sense, but it you’ve been working with many different development technologies, you’ll find it almost incomprehensible. There’s no reason it has to be so hard, but it is.<br \/>RIM’s problem is that it’s old. RIM has done a very good job of forcing their internal development teams to continue to support older devices as new ones (with new capabilities) are released. That’s a good thing, backwards compatibility is very important. Unfortunately that does make it harder on developers – there’s no getting away from it and it’s the kind of thing that Windows developers, Linux developers and many other platform developers live with on a day to day basis.<\/p>\r\n<p>iOS is new, Apple is going to have the same problem in the future. They’ve already started releasing newer devices with higher screen resolutions, so developers now have to deal with two iPhone screen resolutions plus the iPad. As displays get better or form factors change, it won’t be long before Apple developers start complaining about all of the different devices they have to code (or create graphics) for. When apple starts adding additional interfaces (neural and who know what else) the same problem will occur. It’s the way software development works and it has nothing to do with Apple or RIM. For Apple, forcing users off older OS helps eliminate some of those problems. Since users are essentially forced to upgrade as soon as a new version of iOS is released, developers don’t actually have to support older OS’s for that long. Unfortunately, RIM works with enterprises and that’s just not acceptable for most companies.<\/p>\r\n<p>I said a long time ago that RIM should abandon their older devices and release a new, more modern way of building mobile applications. They’ve done that now with their acquisition of QNX, but I agree with the market that this transition has taken too long. Working for a carrier, I understand the pressures RIM and other device manufacturers face, but it is taking them way, way too long to get things done. They announced the PlayBook when they weren’t ready, they released when they were not ready, those aren’t smart things to do. Releasing the PlayBook without native email support is incomprehensible.<\/p>\r\n<p>I truly do not know whether it’s too late for RIM or not. I feel for them and hurt a little inside when I see their repeated stumbles. There’s a whole bunch of smart people there, so there’s a chance they’ll pull it out, but it will take very drastic measures and a lot of pain. Unfortunately, by the time they figure it out, it may be too late.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Remember: The comments presented herein are my personal opinions and in no way represent AT&amp;T (my employer).

{"id":"260","asset_id":"288","title":"What Were They Thinking #9? RIM Again!","alias":"wwtt9","introtext":"<p>For a long time now, I’ve been running a series on mobile applications, highlighting where developers build an application for a mobile device without really paying attention to the mobile device or the needs of the mobile user.&nbsp; In this article, I’m going to shift gears and talk about something related to mobile, but not directly to mobile applications. I’ve written about this company many times before, let’s take a look…<\/p>\r\n<p>I received the following email this morning from Research In Motion. I’d signed up for updates, so they would notify me when new software was available for my device.&nbsp; I thought it was a good idea to keep my BlackBerry device up to date and it was great to receive the notification.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2011\/rim_email1.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>What struck me as odd was not that the image they’d included in the email didn’t load, but instead that they included a note at the top of the message saying:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“For best results, please view this message from your desktop computer.”<\/p>\r\n<p>Seriously? An email from Research In Motion with a suggestion that the email would look better on a desktop computer than on a BlackBerry? That makes absolutely no sense. I have a BlackBerry. They know with a pretty high level of certainty that I have a BlackBerry (since I signed up for BlackBerry software update notifications, didn’t I?). This makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.<\/p>\r\n<p>What they did was format the message so it had a nice layout when opened in the desktop email client. It was designed to center the message’s content in the center of the available space in the email client. Big deal, what’s the point? I don’t need emails content such as this centered in the email. It’s a simple message letting me know that there’s a software update for my BlackBerry device, does it really matter what it looks like?&nbsp; All they did was make it so the message was larger than it needed to be (all of that HTML content used to make the message formatter better on the screen), took longer to download than necessary and costs the receiving company (my employer) additional cost (over text-only messages) to store and forward the message to me.<\/p>\r\n<p>Here’s what the message looked like on my BlackBerry:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2011\/rim_email2.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2<\/p>\r\n<p>Yes, I have my fonts cranked up (I’m old), so it’s bigger that it would be on your device.&nbsp; The image at the top of the message doesn’t appear on my BlackBerry device either, so I’m not sure what’s going on there.<\/p>\r\n<p>What I needed was a simple, text-based email from Research In Motion letting me know there was new software available for my BlackBerry device. I needed to know it was available, how to load it and what is different in the new version (what’s new, what’s been fixed).&nbsp; I didn’t get that. What were they thinking?<\/p>\r\n<p>We need to get back to simple. Use HTML formatted email where it matters – not in simple emails like this. If you know the reader is likely to be reading the email on a smartphone, format the message so it looks OK in both the desktop and smartphone email clients. A message to a BlackBerry user with information about his or her BlackBerry device should be formatted expecting that the message will be opened on a BlackBerry. It makes no sense to do anything else.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"2","created":"2011-07-13 23:52:44","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2016-04-13 00:19:11","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2011-07-13 23:52:44","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"3","ordering":"15","metakey":"BlackBerry, RIM, Research in Motion","metadesc":"What were they thinking #9?

{"id":"261","asset_id":"289","title":"Can’t Speak at BlackBerry DevCon","alias":"speak-devcon","introtext":"<p>I got my ‘thanks but we don’t need you to speak at the BlackBerry Developer Conference’ email this week. I’m really frustrated; I’ve been silent on this for years now, but I have to say something now. Here we go, but be sure to keep in mind that the opinions provided here are mine alone and do not reflect the opinion or public statements of my employer.<\/p>\r\n<p>I’ve attended every BlackBerry Developer Conference. One as an employee of Research In Motion, another as an employee of BoxTone and two as an employee of AT&amp;T. As you may or may not know, after I left Research In Motion, I wrote one of the first books dedicated to BlackBerry development (I usually say mine was the first, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1430272252\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mcnsof-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=1430272252\" target=\"_blank\">Anthony Rizk’s <em>Beginning BlackBerry Development<\/em><\/a> technically made it onto paper a week before mine, but my book, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbdevfundamentals.com\" target=\"_blank\"><em>BlackBerry Development Fundamentals<\/em><\/a> was available online on Safari Books Online months before that).<\/p>\r\n<p>When I was at Research In Motion, I couldn’t present at the conference because I didn’t work in the ISV Alliances team nor did I work on any of the internal BlackBerry development teams. I worked for one of the carrier business units (AT&amp;T of course) and even though I was considered expert enough to work with customers on BlackBerry development stuff, I wasn’t good enough to speak at the conference.<\/p>\r\n<p>The next year, I submitted a couple of session topics but was declined. The following year, folks at Research In Motion actually encouraged me to submit session abstracts, but turned me down anyway. By then, there were two books on BlackBerry development on the market and I’d written one of them (the author of the third book doesn’t even attend the conference). You’d think I would be qualified to speak at the BlackBerry developer conference, but nope – declined. I didn’t submit any topics last year, but I just knew it was an exercise in futility. This year, just like Charlie Brown trying to kick a football being held by Lucy van Pelt, I thought I’d try yet again – declined.<\/p>\r\n<p>The issue for me is that Research In Motion is just too close to some of these topics to present them with any type of real impact. Watching Tariq Tahir year after year present on Push and completely omit important details plus get interrupted time and time again with questions because his presentation wasn’t structured well - was painful. Watching Adam Stanley and Tim Neil present on Widgets (WebWorks) at last year’s conference and get peppered with questions over and over again because they just weren’t explaining the details clearly was painful as well.&nbsp; Developer types at Research In Motion do know their topics, but many are too close to the topics (and therefore omit important, assumed details) and don’t really have the organization and presentation skills needed to impart the information well.<\/p>\r\n<p>Developer Conference sessions should be stuffed full of details, examples and background information. It should be structured in a way optimized for people that don’t know anything about the topic. Research In Motion developers assume too much when they present topics, they assume you know a whole bunch of background information, rather than build their sessions with no assumptions and therefore making a bigger impact on less knowledgeable learners.<\/p>\r\n<p>Let me give you an example. When I was working on the book, one of the chapters dealt with issues with the browser related to problems that occur since JavaScript was turned off by default in the BlackBerry browser. One of the Research In Motion reviewers, made a note indicating that it could easily be turned on programmatically but provided no additional information. I searched everywhere on the Internet looking for any reference to how this could be done and found nothing. Finally after begging for the solution, Research In Motion gave me a quick sentence on how to do it.&nbsp; I worked away at it, with no additional support from Research In Motion and finally figured it out. It’s documented <a href=\"index.php\/blackberry\/programmatically-enabling-javascript-in-the-blackberry-browser.html\" target=\"_blank\">on this site here<\/a> and as far as I can tell, for a very long time (possibly still) it’s the only reference on the Internet that explains how to do it. The reviewer from RIM just assumed I’d understand the comment, even though the information being referenced was NOT explained or documented ANYWHERE.<\/p>\r\n<p>I’ve always wanted to present on BlackBerry Push capabilities. For the longest time, it wasn’t documented very well anywhere within Research In Motion’s documentation, and I felt that I knew more about the topic than most people outside of RIM . I wrote more than 100 pages on push in BlackBerry Development Fundamentals and I think I know it pretty well. If you’re a developer and you want to learn it, there’s on-device API’s that help you leverage it, but for creating server processes that leverage push, the only examples available from RIM help only if you’re using Java on the back-end. If you take a look at Research In Motion’s last documentation on RIM Push <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.blackberry.com\/en\/developers\/deliverables\/1369\/BlackBerry_Browser_Version_4.3_Content_Developer_Guide.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">available here<\/a> you’ll find that the sample application illustrating PAP shown beginning on page 90 will NEVER WORK since the code pasted in there illustrates an example of RIM Push, not PAP. I told Research In Motion about the error years ago, but the documentation was not updated – it’s been wrong for years now.&nbsp; If you want to learn how to do BlackBerry Push by hand, you’ll have to buy my book since Research In Motion’s documentation is wrong and has been wrong for years.<\/p>\r\n<p>Having worked with the technical team responsible for the BlackBerry Developer Conference, while at Research In Motion and later while helping me with the book, those people really don’t know me very well. I was part of the carrier team, rather than being a ‘true’ developer type, so I never felt that they accepted me as a peer.<\/p>\r\n<p>The thing is that I’ve been a professional software developer for almost 30 years. Even though I’ve not been an in the trenches Java developer like the developers at RIM, I still know an awful lot about software development and a whole lot about all aspects of BlackBerry development. I’ve created several commercial software products (by my hand) including two award winning ones. I’m a regular speaker at developer conferences (Lotusphere, The View Domino Developer Conference, MWLUG). I was a certified Novell Netware Instructor (CNI), Lotus Certified Notes Instructor (CLNI) and a United States Soccer Federation (USSF) State Referee Instructor (only about 5% of USSF instructors achieve this status) so I have more than 20 years of experience teaching technical topics to both adults and children. I have a Bachelor’s Degree in Physics with a certificate in Computer Physics. If you look at posts on this site, you should see that the articles are chock full of details and are very well structured. None of the details needed to understand a topic are omitted from my books, articles and conference sessions. I can discuss and teach the deepest possible technical topics to learners at any level; if you’ve seen me present at conferences, you’ll hopefully agree.<\/p>\r\n<p>I give up – if you hear me talking about submitting a speaker abstract for next year’s BlackBerry Developer Conference, please talk me out of it. I’ve moved away from BlackBerry development, instead selling cross platform development tools for AT&amp;T and working on a book on PhoneGap. Perhaps after I’ve published a book on PhoneGap and more articles on this site about cross platform development topics that the PhoneGap community will accept me and let me speak at their conferences. I bet it will be easier to work with that team as an outsider than it is to work with my former colleagues at RIM. I only want to help, to help make the BlackBerry Developer Conference a better experience for attendees. I think I have the knowledge, experience and presenting skills needed to make a big impact, unfortunately I’m not able to make RIM understand that.<\/p>\r\n<p>For the record, RIM has been helpful in supporting the book. They did a  complete technical review of the book and scheduled book signings at the  last two conferences. Even giving me a media pass to one of the  conferences when I'd lost my job at BoxTone and wanted to attend. Sales are winding down though, as BlackBerry development is no longer as important as it was in thos cross platform world.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"2","created":"2011-08-12 14:22:36","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2016-04-13 00:19:11","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2011-08-12 14:22:36","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"6","ordering":"14","metakey":"BlackBerry, BlackBerry Developer Conference, BlackBerry DevCon","metadesc":"Expressing my frustration with my inability to secure a speaking slot at the BlackBerry Developer conference.","access":"1","hits":"7864","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"264","asset_id":"290","title":"RAID 5 Pain","alias":"raid-5-pain","introtext":"<p>At the beginning of the year, I replaced my main PC in my home office. I’d had the last one for more than 4 years and it was really time to get rid of it. When I build a new PC, I always go for the biggest and fastest and this one was really fast 4 years ago, but could no longer keep up.<\/p>\r\n<p>For the new one, I purchased an Intel i7 quad core, dual graphics cards, 24 GB of memory and a big honking 8 TB drive array configured for RAID 5 (giving me 6 TB of available space). For my boot drive, I implemented a solid state drive, very cool but I wish it was bigger (Isn’t that always the case?). I’d previously used AMD processors, but for this one, I knew I’d be doing a lot of work in Virtual Machines so I wanted the hyper threading capabilities of the i7 processor.<\/p>\r\n<p>It wasn’t long after I had this beast up and running that the RAID controller indicated that the third drive in the array was indicating that it was experiencing SMART errors. Soon afterwards the 4th drive failed completely. I quickly ordered a replacement drive from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newegg.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.newegg.com<\/a> (I LOVE those guys) and, when it arrived, replaced the failed drive in the array.<\/p>\r\n<p>I then downloaded the drive diagnostics utility from the Samsung web site (I was using 4, 2 TB Samsung SATA drives for my array) and plugged the drive into one of the test machines in my lab. Quick tests indicated that there was an error with the drive (I already knew that). Surface test indicated that there was a problem with the drive (I still already knew that). After low level formatting the drive, I reran the tests and was informed that the drive was bad (didn’t I already know that?).<\/p>\r\n<p>I opened the manual that came with the drive and saw that I was supposed to call an 800 number to get support. I called the number and after only getting transferred once, spoke with a tech who gave me directions to go to a web site to generate an RMA number. I would have completely avoided the phone call if they would have just given me the support URL in the manual, but apparently that’s not the way it works.<\/p>\r\n<p>I shipped the drive off to Samsung and soon received the replacement drive. I installed the new replacement drive in the drive 3 slot in my RAID array and of course now I’m completing the same steps for the other failed drive. So far, the quick test and surface test have completed and I’m currently low level formatting the drive. Since this drive didn’t actually fail, only threw some SMART errors, I’m not sure what’s going to happen here. I’d prefer to have the drive replaced and have a good backup drive lying around to use when the next drive goes bad.<\/p>\r\n<p>I’m disappointed that I had the drive failures, but I am glad I implemented a RAID Array (so I could easily recover from a failure). What bothers me most is that I have to pay shipping three times to get these two drives replaced under warrantee (one for shipping of the purchased replacement drive and two to send drives back to Samsung). Even though these drives are under warranty, I have to incur a cost to use the warranty.

The WebWorks stuff is…interesting and Hybrid frameworks like WebWorks is where the market is going (the popularity of the PhoneGap and Titanium frameworks has helped prove that one) but there always seemed to me that there would remain the need to write native applications for any device. I couldn’t understand how RIM could be using native development tools to write applications for QNX and more than a year after they announced the device didn’t have any native tools available. I know they expected that these tools would only be needed for high performance applications such as games and specialty drivers, but sometimes you just want to kick around in the API’s directly.<\/p>\r\n<p>By why so late?<\/p>\r\n<p>This is something Google and Apple have definitely done right and RIM seems to completely ignore. When Apple or Google announce an OS upgrade, they release the appropriate SDK’s with the device or even sometimes earlier. RIM on the other hand, doesn’t seem to understand the need to have timely access to the newest development tools. I don’t remember whether it was BlackBerry Device Software 4.6 or 5.0, but I remember that for one of them the native development tools were still in beta almost 6 months after the release of the device running the software. Seriously? C’mon – how hard can it be?

With the device announced more than a year ago and physical devices in the hands of users since May, you’d think a native SDK would have been made available a long time ago, but you’d be wrong.<\/p>\r\n<p>Here’s the announcement: <a href=\"http:\/\/devblog.blackberry.com\/2011\/08\/native-sdk-for-blackberry-tablet-os-closed-beta\/\">http:\/\/devblog.blackberry.com\/2011\/08\/native-sdk-for-blackberry-tablet-os-closed-beta\/<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p>Google and Apple typically make their SDK’s available at device announcement or at least at device release, but Research In Motion has always been slower to market with their development tools. Now, in their defense, they had development tools for PlayBook available at device launch, both WebWorks and Adobe Air development options were available. So not having a native SDK wasn’t a big deal, but any game developer or someone building device drivers would suffer until now. It’s a closed beta, so that means public beta and final release are months away.<\/p>\r\n<p>My only hope is that they can get this figured out before the new QNX-based devices become available supposedly next year.<\/p>\r\n<p>The second announcement was from Mike Kirkup, Research In Motion’s long standing director of their Global Developer Relations team. Mike Announced on <a href=\"http:\/\/mikekirkup.com\/\">http:\/\/mikekirkup.com<\/a> that he was resigning from his position at Research In Motion after 10 years with the company. This isn’t good news and it will be interesting to see who replaces him or what happens with the position. Mike’s team worked with all Research In Motion development partners, helping them bring commercial software products to market. I’m assuming they’ll continue with their work, but I wonder if Mike leaving is related to some fundamental change to how they will support developers and that’s why he’s leaving.<\/p>\r\n<p>On (or about, I can’t remember) July 25<sup>th<\/sup>, Research In Motion made a huge reduction in it’s workforce. The biggest impact I’m aware of was to the US Carrier business units. When I worked at Research In Motion, I was part of the team supporting AT&amp;T. With the reduction in force (RIF), RIM whacked from the AT&amp;T business unit the entire Regional Technical Manager (RTM) team except for one person and as I understand it, cut the Regional Sales Team (RSM) in half. So, what was once a team of between 16 to 20 people is now a team of 5 people.

{"id":"269","asset_id":"295","title":"A New RESTful Service","alias":"a-new-restful-service","introtext":"<p>I have published several articles on this site that illustrated different types of web services for Domino that I have used in some mobile applications. Domino easily supports XML-based web services and platforms such as BlackBerry and Windows Mobile have inherent capabilities that allow applications to consume XML-based web services. Other platforms on the other hand don’t have built-in support for XML-based web services, so I’ve had to implement RESTful services for applications built for other platforms such as Android and iOS. More recently I’ve decided to make a change to the RESTful agent I’ve been using for my applications and thought I’d document the changes here.<\/p>\r\n<p>With my original web services, the idea was that a mobile application would send a request for a list of contacts that matched a search string then, when an application user selected a user, the application would make another call to the server to obtain the details for the selected contact. This process is illustrated in Figure 1.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2011\/drawing1.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1 – Two-part Request Process<\/p>\r\n<p>When I first started doing mobile development, performance was important. The networks were slow and mobile devices had limited processing power, memory and battery life. In order to make the most efficient use of the network and increase performance and battery life for the device, I built the services to make the best use of network and processing power. What this meant was that the services would be designed to send a little data as possible over the wireless network and to ensure that data that would possibly not be used by the mobile application wouldn’t be sent across the wireless network.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, in my design, I deliberately built the services so the first request simply retrieved a list of contacts that matched the search string then allowed the application to get detailed contact information only after they determined which contact they were interested in.<\/p>\r\n<p>It seemed like a good approach and has served me rather well. The problem with this approach though is that it makes building the mobile application more difficult. There are two calls to the server and the results have to be parsed twice as well. If the mobile user selects one contact, then decides it’s the wrong one and switches to another, there’s another trip to the server for more data.<\/p>\r\n<p>It’s efficient on the network, but inefficient within the application. The thing is, mobile users and mobile device manufacturers stopped caring about network usage and battery life a long time ago. Users want whatever they want and they want it now.<\/p>\r\n<p>Apple’s Dashcode IDE has some pretty cool features that make it easy to work with remote data sets. When you build a Browser project using one of Dashcode’s wizards, the application expects a list of records and the details behind the list to all be delivered to the application at one time. The result is only one trip to the server, and a better user experience. There’s only one trip forth and back from the server which makes the user feel better, but we’re delivering data to the mobile device application that the user may never look at. Oh well.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, I decided to rewrite my Domino Directory lookup agent so all of the relevant data could be retrieved with a single call to the RESTful agent as shown in Figure 2.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2011\/drawing2.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2 – Single Part Request Process<\/p>\r\n<p>With this new service, a single call is made to the server using the following URL:{codecitation class=\"brush:text; gutter:false\"}http:\/\/server\/database.nsf\/contactlookuprest?openagent&amp;ss=SEARCH_STRING{\/codecitation}<\/p>\r\n<p>where SEARCH_STRING represents the first three characters (or so) of the contact name the user will be searching for. As an example, a call to the server using the following URL:{codecitation class=\"brush:text; gutter:false\"}http:\/\/server\/database.nsf\/contactlookuprest?openagent&amp;ss=war{\/codecitation}<br \/>would return the following JSON data (or something like it):<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">[{\"FullName\":\"Anna Wargo\", \"LastName\":\"Wargo\", \"FirstName\":\"Anna\", \"EmailAddress\":\"awargo@somecompany.com\", \"OfficePhone\":\"330.665.1234\", \"MobilePhone\":\"330.999.1234\"}, {\"FullName\":\"John Wargo\", \"LastName\":\"Wargo\", \"FirstName\":\"John\", \"EmailAddress\":\"john@johnwargo.com\", \"OfficePhone\":\"330.123.4567\", \"MobilePhone\":\"330.987.6543\"}]<\/span><br \/><br \/>The JSON text returned from the server in this case is an array of JavaScript objects. If you expand the JSON text to show the structure of the data, the data will look like the following:<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">[<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">&nbsp;{<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">&nbsp; \"FullName\":\"Anna Wargo\",<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\"><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">&nbsp; <\/span> \"LastName\":\"Wargo\",<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\"><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">&nbsp; <\/span> \"FirstName\":\"Anna\",<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\"><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">&nbsp; <\/span> \"EmailAddress\":\"awargo@somecompany.com\",<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\"><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">&nbsp; <\/span> \"OfficePhone\":\"330.665.1234\",<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\"><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">&nbsp; <\/span> \"MobilePhone\":\"330.999.1234\"<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">&nbsp;},<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">&nbsp;{<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\"><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">&nbsp; <\/span> \"FullName\":\"John Wargo\",<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\"><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">&nbsp; <\/span> \"LastName\":\"Wargo\",<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\"><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">&nbsp; <\/span> \"FirstName\":\"John\",<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\"><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">&nbsp; <\/span> \"EmailAddress\":\"john@johnwargo.com\",<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\"><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">&nbsp; <\/span> \"OfficePhone\":\"330.123.4567\",<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\"><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">&nbsp; <\/span> \"MobilePhone\":\"330.987.6543\"<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">&nbsp;}<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">]<\/span><br \/><br \/>I can use this data in my application by only pulling out the list of FullName values when presenting a list of contacts, then digging in and displaying the contact details only after a contact has been selected within the application.<\/p>\r\n<p>The brackets (the ‘[‘ and ’]’ characters) are used to define an array and the curly braces ( the ‘{‘ and ‘}’ characters) are used to define a JavaScript object. So, what you’re seeing is a essentially a two element array, where each element is a complete JavaScript object describing contact details for a user defined in the Domino Directory database.<\/p>\r\n<p>To obtain this output, all you need is a simple agent in a Domino Directory database. To create the RESTful service, create a new agent in your Domino Directory and set the agent properties shown in Figure 3. The agent is a web agent; it is triggered by a URL request triggered by the mobile application (or web browser). It uses an ‘On Event’ trigger and the event is defined as ‘Agent list selection.’<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2011\/image3.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 3 – Domino RESTful Agent Properties<\/p>\r\n<p>Most of the agent’s work is done in the Initialize subroutine which performs the following steps:<\/p>\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parse the incoming URL to determine the search string being passed in by the calling program.<br \/>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Search the ($VIMPeopleByLastName) view to locate all users defined in the database whose last name begins with the characters provided in the search string.<br \/>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loop through the search results and create the JSON array described previously.<br \/>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Print the JSON array text to the console which causes it to be returned to the program that triggered the URL.<\/p>\r\n<p>In the code, the GetCmdLineValue function is used to parse the HTTP QUERY_STRING variable to retrieve values passed on the URL.<\/p>\r\n<p>Here is the complete code for the agent:<\/p>\r\n<p>{codecitation class=\"brush:vb; gutter:true\"}%REM<br \/> Agent ContactLookupREST<br \/> Created Jan 13, 2010 by John M.

As I poked and prodded around on the Internet I was struggling to find the information I needed about installing those two tools on Mac OS. It was really frustrating and I couldn’t figure out why nobody had written about the topic when I discovered by accident that the Macintosh installs Ant and Java by default. Nice!<\/p>\r\n<p>On my new Mac Mini running OS X Lion, Java isn’t installed, but installs itself when you first try to run a Java application. That’s pretty cool.

{"id":"275","asset_id":"301","title":"BlackBerry DevCon Day 1","alias":"bbdevcon1","introtext":"<p>Well, Day of BlackBerry DevCon 2011 has wrapped up and it’s been a pretty interesting day.<\/p>\r\n<p>It started with RIM moving the start time of the opening session to 8:30 AM then delaying the start until 8:50 AM. I showed up later than I wanted to, about 8:20, and there was a huge line of people waiting to get in. Fortunately for me, I didn’t have to wait long and was quickly let in. Being a DevCon Alumnus allowed me to use the line jumper queue and get in right away.<\/p>\r\n<p>It makes no sense to me – why move the start time up then NOT start the event. I had a meeting at 11, so I knew I would be leaving early and the earlier start time would have allowed me to miss less of the event. It makes no sense to me why you’d delay like that. No announcements were made; nobody knew what was going on until they finally let us in right when it was supposed to be starting.<\/p>\r\n<p>Then, as we sat there waiting, and waiting and waiting, they made announcements letting us know the keynote would be starting in 5 minutes, then 1 minute. Unfortunately, they made those announcements repeatedly during the 20 minutes I sat waiting. It’s not right and it’s disrespectful of my time.<\/p>\r\n<p>Not much in the way of special announcements. Mike L. started with apologizing for the outages the previous week then announced the new platform would be called BBX. Nothing about features. Nothing about release timeframes. Nothing about the future BlackBerry devices that would be running the OS. Only an announcement about what it would be called and nothing else. Many people have emailed me asking about the mood at the event and how people were reacting to the BBX announcement and so far nobody has anything to really react to. All we know is what it’s going to be called, nothing else – so it’s no surprise that people are not that excited.<\/p>\r\n<p>We did get free Playbook devices – which is really cool. They provided us with an option to receive a device with the standard version of the OS or a device running a beta version of the OS. I’d tell you which version I selected, but it would be a violation of the beta agreement they required anyone who took a beta device to sign for me to tell you which one I selected. I now have two playbook devices, I’ll unpack the new one and play with it’s updated OS when I get home. Unfortunately I’m unable to write about my experiences.<\/p>\r\n<p>They did announce new versions of some of the developer tools and even released Macintosh versions of them (which is pretty cool). I’ve been using a Macintosh for my development work for the PhoneGap book I’m writing and my work laptop died last week, so I had to switch to my MacBook for a while. I’m trying to decide whether I want to make the switch permanent. I’ll write about some ‘interesting’ installation problems soon.<\/p>\r\n<p>With no fanfare or real introduction as to who this guy was, the Mike Kirkup replacement took the stage and announced all sorts of interesting (and welcome) changes to the BlackBerry developer web site. Everything’s been renamed around the BlackBerry Jam concept and it really makes no sense to me. It’s flashy and cool, but it’s at the same time lame and unprofessional. They did announce that RIM would no longer require a login to download the developer tools, which is a long overdue change. That makes downloading tools less challenging (what was that password again?) since RIM required capital letters and alternate characters such as dashes and numbers for your password (which was way, way overkill for simply downloading free developer tools).<\/p>\r\n<p>The keynote was mostly about Game developers and that’s no real change from last year. In today’s cross platform world for Enterprises, it makes sense that RIM would focus on the developers that matter the most to them: game developers.<\/p>\r\n<p>Very little was said about Java development and there are very few sessions here about Java development tools. It’s clear that WebWorks is working for RIM and RIM’s developers, so no real loss there. What will happen is that native Java development will only be needed for device driver or very high performance game development going forward.<\/p>\r\n<p>The afternoon was filled with attending sessions. This year the sessions have been interesting. I’ve enjoyed most of them although very few of them have had the technical depth I wanted them to have. Still, the sessions have been very interesting. Open source tools are more prevalent this year. I’ve attended sessions on JQuery and Dojo, and there have been sessions by Sencha (I think ) and one on PhoneGap I’m attending tomorrow.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"2","created":"2011-10-19 03:29:24","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2016-04-13 00:19:11","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2011-10-19 03:29:24","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"1","ordering":"11","metakey":"BlackBerry DevCon 2011","metadesc":"BlackBerry DevCon 2011 - day 1","access":"1","hits":"7080","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"276","asset_id":"302","title":"What Were They Thinking #10","alias":"wwtt10","introtext":"<p>In preparation for BlackBerry DevCon 2011, RIM released this year's version of the DevCon mobile application. I've written here about this application and the BlackBerry World (WES) conference applications over the years and I've never been quite happy with the applications. I've always felt that the applications were hard to use and included features that just weren't needed in an application like this. My belief was that RIM focused too much on making a flashy, showcase application instead of focusing in an application that got the job done as efficiently as possible.<\/p>\r\n<p>This year's BlackBerry World and DevCon applications were different. They are highly useful, efficient and got the job done. Gone were the fancy background graphics that made the menus difficult to read and gone too were those ridiculous page transitions that took so much time to get you from one screen to another. This year's DevCon application just works and I found myself actually using it for a change rather than using the desktop web version and downloading session information into my calendar.<\/p>\r\n<p>It looks and feels like the application is a BlackBerry WebWorks application. It shouldn't be possible to tell, but for some reason I just 'know' it's a WebWorks application. The cool thing is that because it's a WebWorks application, it was very easy for RIM to make it available for both BlackBerry and Playbook devices. That's a great testament to the application direction RIM has taken.<\/p>\r\n<p>There were some problems with the application though, and that's why this particular post made it into the What Were They Thinking category. In this case though, I'm really not trying to complain here (as I usually do with this particular series), but instead to point out design or implementation decisions that were made that probably should have been made differently.<\/p>\r\n<p>Let me show you what I mean:<\/p>\r\n<p>When looking at the application home screen shown in Figure 1, it's really hard to tell that the icons shown there are clickable. They look like they're disabled. They use color for the logout button and the DevCon logo, but deliberately didn't use color to indicate clickable areas on the home screen. Those icons are dull and truly (to me) do not look like anything I should be able to click on.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"images\/stories\/2011\/bb_devcon_2011_app0.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>As you will see later, other parts of the application are rich with color, but not the home screen icons. What were they thinking? ;-)<\/p>\r\n<p>A neat new feature for this year's application was the ability to synchronize your event schedule with your BlackBerry calendar. Finally! For previous conferences, you could do your calendar on the desktop web and download them into a calendar program (Microsoft Outlook, IBM Lotus Notes and so on), but it was challenging to do it from the mobile application. With this year's application, synchronization is automatic and it's an excellent feature.<\/p>\r\n<p>One thing I noticed though, and I probably wouldn't have noticed it except that it caused me a problem, was that the calendar appointments the application made for me were not marked as Busy on my calendar. One of the reasons I liked the calendar sync was that it updated my calendar so colleagues would see that I'm busy and not schedule appointments for me during those time slots. I had people trying to schedule me for meetings in time slots I knew I had blocked for sessions I was attending. It was only when I looked at some of the entries created by the program that I realized that even though the DevCon app made the appointments for me, it simply didn't make them the right way. What's the point of putting an item in my calendar but not marking my time as busy for that time slot? What were they thinking?<\/p>\r\n<p>Another thing I noticed, and this is a HUGE pet peeve for me, is that when you open the agenda or my schedule, the application doesn't by default open the current day's schedule. The application knows what day it is and it knows I'm opening my schedule, why not default to opening the current day's schedule then give me options to select different days if I want? The designer of the application has to think about how the application will be used; in this case they didn't. 99% of the time I'm going to be looking at my current day's calendar, why not show it to me first instead of making me click the current day every single time I open that part of the application. I shouldn't have to make a selection on the screen shown in Figure 2 every single time I open that part of the application.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"images\/stories\/2011\/bb_devcon_2011_app1.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2<\/p>\r\n<p>Open the current day's schedule no matter what then give me previous day and next day buttons on the top to use to get to a different day. It's only a three day conference, so it would never take more than two clicks to get to any day but only one click to get to the current day.<\/p>\r\n<p>Another thing I noticed about Figure 2 is that it's impossible to tell that the BlackBerry Partner Directory image at the bottom of the page is a clickable item. I noticed by accident that it was there and clicked on it to see if it was clickable only to be surprised to see that it was. Why have an additional item on the page that breaks the theme of clickable items? In the UI, they have things that look clickable (the list of the event dates for example) and other things that are clickable, but don't look clickable. That's bad design. What were they thinking?<\/p>\r\n<p>The next thing really surprised me since it's such a simple thing and it's pretty glaring. Take a look at Figures 3 and 4 below. Notice how much bigger the DevCon icon is compared to other icons on the BlackBerry and Playbook. The icon seems to match the 'theme' of the device or at least not look out of place against the other icons, but no effort was made to make the icon proportional to the other icons on the device.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2011\/bb_devcon_2011_app2.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 3<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"images\/stories\/2011\/bb_devcon_2011_app3.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 4<\/p>\r\n<p>How hard would it have been to make application icons that fit with the other icons on the device? As you can see from the BlackBerry Torch screen shot in Figure 3, the icon is so big that the icon and label scrunch up against each other.<\/p>\r\n<p>For both examples, the application title is so long that it truncates. Why would you ever assign an application title that no matter what will always be truncated on any device it is installed on? It's clear that whoever created this application wasn't paying attention when they created the application icon and assigned the title for the application.

{"id":"277","asset_id":"303","title":"BlackBerry Development Tool Macintosh Installation Weirdness","alias":"bbmactoolinstall","introtext":"<p>I was excited to learn at BlackBerry DevCon 2011 that RIM had finally released the Macintosh versions of their development tools for BlackBerry and Playbook development. Having a MacBook in my hotel room (my Windows Laptop died ore than a week ago) I downloaded the code and tried to install it. I noticed some weirdness with the tool installation, so I thought I'd write about my experiences here.<\/p>\r\n<p>The tools download as a zip file, a different zip file for BlackBerry vs. Playbook development. That's not that big of a deal, except the zip files contain an application installer with EXACTLY the same name. Instead of naming the packager within each zip file with a name appropriate for the particular installer, they named them both the same and it causes problems. Take a look at Figure 1, you'll see the two zip files (with separate file names) but then two applications, both with the same name (although the second one has a 2 after it's file name).<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2011\/bb_dev_tool_install0.png\" alt=\"Finder Image\" width=\"640\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>How do you tell which one is which? You can tell by the file sizes (very different between BlackBerry and Playbook), but you shouldn't have to – especially since the Macintosh Finder doesn't render files in this layout by default. RIM should have thought of this scenario and named the installers better.<\/p>\r\n<p>OK, when I got around to installing the tools, I came across something I'd never seen before on a Macintosh. Take a look at Figure 2, it shows the first screen you see when installing the tools. When I first saw this message, I had absolutely no idea what to do with the information. I knew that Windows would allow me to run an installer as an Administrator, but had no idea how to do that on a Macintosh.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"images\/stories\/2011\/bb_dev_tool_install1.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2<\/p>\r\n<p>I closed the installer and poked around to see if I could figure out how to run the application as an Administrator. I couldn't find anything, so I just launched the installer again. I stared at the screen for a while then decided that the only option available to me was to click the lock icon and see what happened.<\/p>\r\n<p>Guess what? It prompted me for the Administrator's (me) password as shown in Figure 3 and proceeded to perform the installation.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"images\/stories\/2011\/bb_dev_tool_install2.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 3<\/p>\r\n<p>What concerns me though is why I had to go through that? Why didn't the install just progress and leverage the feature of the Macintosh that prompts me for the password? That stupid little lock icon didn't make sense, nor did the prompt that apparently was trying to tell me that I needed to click the lock icon to get past this particular issue.<\/p>\r\n<p>I've said this before, if there's only one option available to me, why not just click it for me automatically? Why make me click it when there's really nothing else I can do? Why doesn't the installer provide a message that tells me I need an Administrator password then politely let me know I can enter said password by clicking the lock icon? There was absolutely no way for me to know, based upon the information provided me, that the lock icon allowed me to enter the Administrator password. Why put the lock icon, the only thing I can and should click as far away as possible from the message warning me that I needed to click the icon?<\/p>\r\n<p>It's almost like they really don't want me to install the tools. Ugh!<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"2","created":"2011-10-21 14:00:00","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2016-04-13 00:19:11","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2011-10-21 14:00:00","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"5","ordering":"10","metakey":"BlackBerry Developer Tools, Macintosh, BlackBerry DevCon","metadesc":"Had some problems installing the brand new BlackBerry development tools for Macintosh","access":"1","hits":"8257","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

I was really looking forward to the content, but the presenter was interrupted with so many general questions about PhoneGap (rather than questions related to the session's content) that he ran out of time and only covered about half of his presentation. I wish he'd enforced only taking questions at the end of the session and gave me what I was looking for from the session. Oh well. What RIM should have done was have an intro to PhoneGap session first, which would have allowed this more advanced session to cover its content as planned.<\/p>\r\n<p>I learned a lot about many open source JavaScript libraries – as soon as I wrap up the book I plan on digging more into those libraries just to round out my skills.<\/p>\r\n<p>Not sure if I'll be attending another DevCon.

I've been working through the book's API chapters, writing applications that highlight the capabilities of each and using PhoneGap Build to quickly build an application I can test on multiple devices. It allows me to simply create the index.html file I need, post it up to the server and within minutes (PhoneGap Build is NOT fast) get an application I can deploy to devices for testing.<\/p>\r\n<p>This capability is especially helpful when I was working with the API's related to physical hardware (such as the compass and the accelerometer) since those applications had to run on physical devices and it's much simpler to deploy via the web for testing.<\/p>\r\n<p>I first noticed the problem when none of the BlackBerry applications I was working with would fire the deviceready event. After a lot of poking around, I discovered that the problem indicated that the PhoneGap.js file wasn't being included in the BlackBerry application's executable (the .cod file). It would work every once in a while, but 99.9% of the time, PhoneGap Build would build the app, but forget to include the critical phonepap.js file needed to access any of the PhoneGap API's.<\/p>\r\n<p>I searched the knowledge base and found another who was having the same problem and even submitted my own tickets on the problem, but as of yesterday it still wasn't working.

It allows you to quickly pen an app by only writing the index.html (and associated files) then gives you apps for multiple platforms without all of the fuss and muss of creating projects for each platform.

Not important, but interesting.<\/p>\r\n<p>Postscript: OK, I was randomly thinking about something this morning and the solution to this particular item popped into my head. The reason why the PhoneGap alert displays after the JavaScript alert is that the PhoneGap call is asynchronous and the JavaScript alert is a synchronous call. The application passes off the call to display the PhoneGap alert then immediately calls the JavaScript function to display the alert. The JavaScript code executes faster while the PhoneGap code is getting it's work done, the JavaScript code has already fired and is blocking the PhoneGap alert function until the user clicks the OK button.<\/p>\r\n<p>Yep, it helps when you actually think through things.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"14","created":"2011-11-20 03:03:53","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2011-11-20 03:03:53","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"8","ordering":"66","metakey":"PhoneGap Essentials, PhoneGap, PhoneGap alert, deviceready, JavaScript alert","metadesc":"Encountered a situation where a PhoneGap alert fires after a preceding JavaScript alert.","access":"1","hits":"9398","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

They finally fixed it today, but it was broken for about 20 days, and that was painful.<\/p>\r\n<p>Recently, I've been focusing on Android development since the BlackBerry stuff was broken. Unfortunately the Android stuff is partially broken as well. You can build an app for Android using PhoneGap Build, but about 70% of the time, the application that's built for you won't install on an Android device.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you take a look at the following figure you'll see an example of what I'm experiencing. The two downloads shown in the figure are for the exact same application. When I build an Android application using PhoneGap Build and it's 3k smaller than I expect it to be, I know it won't install on the device. I just go back to the portal and start the build again. Most of my evenings have been spent repeatedly rebuilding the same app over and over and over again to get one version that will install.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2011\/device-2011-11-22-205526.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>The problem is that there's no efficient way to communicate build problems to the PhoneGap Build team. There's the help pages that you can link to directly from Build, but people are using that forum for any PhoneGap related question, so there's no easy way to just see what kind of problems are being encountered for Build. People should be using the Google Groups PhoneGap forums for general development stuff and leave the help forum associated with the Build portal for Build related questions.<\/p>\r\n<p>Another problem with that forum is that there's no easy way to see your own posts. Anything I've posted up there is just there and I can't open a page and see my questions and the associated responses. Google Groups is the same way and it's really frustrating.

{"id":"292","asset_id":"315","title":"PhoneGap Beginner's Guide","alias":"phonegap-beginners-guide","introtext":"<p>Although there are many books out there that mention PhoneGap or cover the topic lightly, it was nice to see books in the works entirely on PhoneGap. With <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1849515360\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mcnsof-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1849515360\">PhoneGap Beginner's Guide<\/a> being the first one out the gate, I was excited to receive my copy. Unfortunately I agree with many of the other reviewers on Amazon in that there were a lot of incomprehensible sentences in the book. It's clear that Packt, like with many other of their books, rushed this one out and didn't give it the thorough read it needed.<\/p>\r\n<p>The bigger thing for me was that the book's really not about PhoneGap. Sure, there is a chapter on installing the PhoneGap framework and tools and there are a few chapters on the PhoneGap API's, but the majority of the book covers mobile web development rather than PhoneGap. The majority of the example applications shown in the book were demonstrated in the desktop browser rather than in a native application built using PhoneGap. I understand that you can test some UI stuff in the desktop browser, but PhoneGap has No UI API's - none. So why would you write a PhoneGap book that's mostly about UI? PhoneGap is all about interacting with the device, so as soon as a developer creates their application's UI and starts using the PhoneGap API's, they have to leave the desktop browser and either test in a real PhoneGap application or use RIM's Ripple emulator.<\/p>\r\n<p>I did a quick count and there's only about 76 pages on PhoneGap related topics (out of a total of 283 pages – about 25%) while the rest of the book is all about how to do mobile web development. I didn't buy a PhoneGap book to learn about Mustache, XUI or jQuery Mobile – I bought the book to learn more about PhoneGap. I figured since the author worked for Nitobi (the creators of PhoneGap) that I'd learn things I didn't know. Not the case.<\/p>\r\n<p>I truly believe this book should have been called Mobile Web Development for PhoneGap Developers – that way the purchaser would at least know that this book is more about mobile web development than it is about PhoneGap.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that I'm in the process of completing my own book on PhoneGap called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1849515360\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mcnsof-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1849515360\">PhoneGap Essentials<\/a>, so I may be a little biased. One of the things I do while writing Essentials is to assess every topic against the title of the book. I'm regularly trying to pull stuff out of the book because it's not related to PhoneGap. If you read <em>PhoneGap Essentials<\/em>, you'll find that it's all about PhoneGap, nothing else. Since PhoneGap doesn't have any UI API's, you'll find some pretty horrible UI's in the sample applications I'm including in the book. Everything's focused on how to use the PhoneGap framework and tools and how to use the PhoneGap API's (all of them) in your PhoneGap applications. If you're an experienced PhoneGap developer, don't buy the book – you're only going to be disappointed. If, on the other hand, you're new to PhoneGap and want to know what PhoneGap is all about, then <em>PhoneGap Essentials<\/em> is the book for you.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"14","created":"2011-11-27 19:22:39","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2011-11-27 19:22:39","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"2","ordering":"64","metakey":"PhoneGap, PhoneGap Essentials, PhoneGap Beginner's Guide","metadesc":"A quick review of PhoneGap Beginner's Guide","access":"1","hits":"7436","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

I was sadly disappointed (is that redundant?) when I heard RIM was delaying the release of the new QNX-based devices until late next year. That's a truly boneheaded move after a series of boneheaded moves.<\/p>\r\n<p>First they announce that future devices will be running QNX. 6 months or so later, they give the new OS a name – BBX, only to find out LATER that that name was already taken. What? Nobody thought to do a trademark search? Apple's pretty pigheaded about that particular topic (Apple was taken by Apple Records when they opened their doors, Macintosh was a very prominent high-end stereo component manufacturer and even one or more of the iNames were infringed upon), but they always seem to get away with it. RIM's failure to recognize the conflict in using BBX was an arrogant, clueless mistake.<\/p>\r\n<p>When they announced they were changing the name to BB 10, I was surprised. Considering that we're on BlackBerry Device Software 7 right now, making the leap to 10 seemed...misguided. Of course the press grumbled about the name never seeming to get how they probably chose it. BBX becoming BB 10? Of course, converting the Roman numeral X into 10 makes perfect sense. Why are so many other people missing that?<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, as I tweeted about this the other day, this particular market moves in months, not years. Samsung, Apple, HTC, Motorola and many others release several new phone models a year, often one or more every three months or so. It's a fast moving, dynamic market and RIM just doesn't seem to get it. Announcing a completely new platform then expecting people to wait 18 months or more to see it just doesn't make sense. It's arrogant and clueless. The solution to RIM's problems is to get a smart, new, sexy device platform to market as quickly as possible – no later than early this year (January or February of 2011). RIM's completely capable of doing it, but they just don't seem to be able to actually do it.<\/p>\r\n<p>It's possible that they ran into some issues and that's the cause for the delay. Staking a brand new product line on a series of chips that won't be out until a year after you need them doesn't make sense. If they have the OS, Apps and features locked down, move on and don't wait for that super-duper, special chipset. If you truly believe you can change the market with these new devices, then get it done.<\/p>\r\n<p>Ugh.<\/p>\r\n<p>I'm trying to figure out what's going to happen to them in the next 6 months:<\/p>\r\n<p>1. No new devices till late in the year (they've already announced that)<\/p>\r\n<p>2. Unbearable pressure to get rid of Mike and Jim<\/p>\r\n<p>3. Acquisition?<\/p>\r\n<p>They're going to be acquired. So many pundits believe it will be Microsoft, but that makes absolutely no sense. I just can't figure out who'd buy them and why. On top of that, what would be left when the purchase completed? The best and brightest minds are leaving en masse, my former colleagues at RIM are Linking In to me in great numbers lately. RIM is Mike L, but I can't imagine Mike staying after any acquisition, so how great can BlackBerry be with Mike at the design helm?

I'll monitor this one for a while and see how well it works.<\/p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately for those who'd posted comments previously, they are no longer available. I'm sorry. I still have the content, so perhaps I'll be able to show them or import them into the new commenting system.<\/p>\r\n<p>Postscript:<\/p>\r\n<p>I looked back and there were 70 comments posted to the site (using the previous comments tool) over the last 2 years or so. I feel bad about removing them from the site, but I'm not sure what to do with them. I can display them all by themselves in a view, but then you'd lose context by reading them. Many of them were useful comments about particular articles or kudos for a particular solution I wrote about here. I think I'm going to have to just delete them and get on with my life.

{"id":"299","asset_id":"322","title":"Silly Spammers","alias":"silly-spammers","introtext":"<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>I’m kinda fascinated with spam (the email kind, not the tasty breakfast meat). I’ve had one or more email accounts since the early days of the Internet and it’s been fascinating to watch how the spammer industry has adjusted to different efforts by email recipients to thwart them.<\/p>\r\n<p>I’ve recently seen an increase in the number of emails I get (from complete strangers of course) asking me to help them bring some money they’ve acquired into the US through my bank accounts. What gets me though is that they still keep coming. Do people really, still fall for that? Do people really think someone’s going to just give them millions? Are people really that gullible? I think perhaps they are.<\/p>\r\n<p>In the last year, I’ve received a whole bunch of spam designed to look like the FBI or IRS is trying to give me back some money I’m supposedly owed. I can’t believe people fall for those scams either. The FBI doesn’t have my email address and I know the IRS isn’t emailing me.<\/p>\r\n<p>What’s funny is watching the spammers as they test their spamming software. I received the following email today:<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2011\/spam%2020111227.png\" width=\"640\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>Oooh, a Bank of America bill payment was cancelled. I’d better do something about that. Actually, I usually get emails from all sorts of banks – ones I don’t have accounts with, so it’s easy to tell which ones are spam.&nbsp; This one happens to ‘be’ from a bank I actually do business with, so it was worth looking into this one. The first thing I noticed was that even though the message was ‘from’ Bank of America, it actually came from a Yahoo address. Yep, times must be tough if BofA has switched to using Yahoo for it’s corporate email. Right!<\/p>\r\n<p>The next thing I noticed was that there was no body to the email. Interesting. What am I supposed to do here? There’s no content in the email. Nice. I guess the spammer forgot to include the actual body of the email message. How then are they going to get me to do something dangerous – like click an innocuous looking link in the email?<\/p>\r\n<p>I also love how this particular spammer included a whole bunch of email addresses in the To field. Ya, I’m sure Bank of America’s sending out emails to a bunch of people simultaneously about a cancelled bill payment. What, so we all had the same bill payment scheduled?<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, experience and some common sense makes it really easy to identify spam messages. I know I’m more technical than the everyday person, but how hard is it to tell this is not a valid email? Why do people keep falling for these kinds of things? You’d think by now we’d all be trained on how to avoid scams and spam.<\/p>\r\n<p>I used to use Qurb to block spam in my email account. I LOVED it. It was essentially a whitelisting tool – it only allowed messages in that were from people I’d emailed or from contacts defined in my address book. It was a perfect solution and I loved it (I know, I already said that). I’d periodically go into my spam box and unblock legitimate emails (the sender would then automatically become whitelisted) and after 30 days, Qurb would delete everything else). Did I mention I loved that particular solution?<\/p>\r\n<p>Many years CA purchased Qurb and changed it to CA AntiSpam. Not much with the product changed, so I was pretty happy with it for a very long time. I renewed my subscription year after year and was very happy with the product. Unfortunately, CA got greedy and decided the bundle their Antivirus with the Antispam solution. You couldn’t purchase one without the other. I’ve always been a big fan of Norton Antivirus, so I had no interest in acquiring a license to CA Antivirus. For a while, I’d renew anyway and just disable the antivirus, but that became tedious and when I upgraded to a 64-bit version of Windows then later upgraded to Windows 7 the solution stopped working for me anyway, so I gave up. I supposedly have a license for the software that’s compatible with the 64-bit version of Windows 7 I’m running, but I just can’t get it work, so I gave up. Too bad, I really wish I had that product running on this computer.<\/p>\r\n<p>I have a ‘work’ email account I use for business related email correspondence; it’s connected with my side business, McNelly SoftWorks. I use Thunderbird for that email account and for years was very careful to not post that email address anywhere where strangers could get to it and send me spam. Something interesting happened recently, and I got on one or more spammer’s lists and a good 50% of the email I get to that account is now spam. What happened? Well, I didn’t do anything to put my email address on the spam lists (as far as I know), but one of my old customers was regularly getting virus attacks and during one of them, his virus grabbed my email address and gave it to spammers. I started getting a bunch of spam messages from this particular customer, and a few days later, I began getting 50 or so spam messages a day. I’d never thought of that scenario, and I wish I could do something to get off those spam lists. I don’t want to change the email address; I’ve had that one for a very long time.<\/p>\r\n<p>Ugh, I don’t know what to do. The Bayesian filtering in Outlook is pretty good, but I still get a bunch of spam I have to mark manually and delete. I wish there was something like Qurb for Thunderbird. Let me know if you know of a solution.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2011-12-28 01:39:48","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2011-12-28 01:39:48","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"1","ordering":"94","metakey":"Spam, Bank of America","metadesc":"Silly spammers, some analysis of a spam email I received today.","access":"1","hits":"6555","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

I'd also shared my Lotusphere experiences with several very close friends that I've worked with for many (many, many) years.<\/p>\r\n<p>When I started my first job out of College at Basicomputer, we were all young geeks and many of us have stayed close over the years. Regarding a few of the guys (like Mike Mantho, Jeff Welch and David Via), we worked together in several jobs over the years. David, Mike and I all got into Lotus Notes at the same time (back in the Notes 2 timeframe) and we attended Lotusphere (with Jeff) together for many, many years. Mike's working at RIM and no longer makes it to Lotusphere. David remained tightly involved with Lotus (being an IBM employee) so I knew I would see him at Lotusphere every year. I might even go so far as to say that hanging out with him was one of my primary reasons for still going to Lotusphere these last few years. David is one of my best friends and hanging out with him at Lotusphere was one of my favorite yearly traditions.<\/p>\r\n<p>Mike and Jeff have moved on to different things, and this year there's big changes for David as well. Although David Via has been very involved with Notes (now Domino) for so long, time are changing for him as well – he recently left his position at IBM and is joining the team I'm on at AT&amp;T. No more Lotusphere's for either of us most likely.<\/p>\r\n<p>David wrapped up his job at IBM at the end of the year and starts his new position (working with me again, amazing) at AT&amp;T next week.

Here ya go:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 30px;\"><cite>“Wozniak conceded that Android is a better choice for people who actually know what they're doing when it comes to technology.”<\/cite><\/p>\r\n<p>That statement is absolutely correct. I’ve been having a long, heated argument with some long time colleagues about this topic and it’s really true. If you don’t know what you’re doing or if you don’t have any real experience with mobile technology, the iPhone is an amazing device. If you know what you’re doing and you have experience with smartphones, the iPhone will drive you crazy.<\/p>\r\n<p>I gave my wife an iPad and when her laptop died, I expected her to just use the iPad for everything. No can do – she hates it. She knows what she’s doing and knows what she wants to be able to do with the device and since iOS blocks her from doing what she wants in so many ways, the device drives her crazy and she hardly uses it.<\/p>\r\n<p>Is this what Apple expected? No, but I imagine they don’t really care.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"15","created":"2012-01-18 15:24:08","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2012-01-18 15:24:08","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"3","ordering":"15","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"8776","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"305","asset_id":"328","title":"BlackBerry About","alias":"blackberry-about","introtext":"<p>I can't remember why, but for some reason I wanted to look at my BlackBerry device software version the other day, so I fired up the Options application and started typing 'about' as shown in the following figure. I noticed some interesting things and that prompted me to write this post.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2012\/BlackBerry-About1.jpg\" alt=\"BlackBerry Options Application\" title=\"BlackBerry Options Application\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>When you first launch the application, it displays a screen similar to the one shown in the following figure. I'm running a BlackBerry Bold 9900 and I absolutely love it. It's small, fast, easy to use and I just have to have a full keyboard – makes me more efficient.<\/p>\r\n<p>The device is running BlackBerry Device Software 7, which I knew, but you'll notice that it's running Platform version 5.0.0.680. I've written about this before here, but I had to bring it up again. So many people incorrectly refer to 'BlackBerry OS' when what they really mean is BlackBerry Device Software version. In this case, I'm running BlackBerry Device Software 7, but the OS is actually 5.0. So, people who say BlackBerry OS 7 are referring to an operating system that technically doesn't exist (yet). RIM refers to it as BlackBerry 7 OS which in actuality means the OS running BlackBerry Device Software 7, not version 7 of the BlackBerry OS. Make sense?<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2012\/BlackBerry-About2.jpg\" alt=\"BlackBerry About Application\" title=\"BlackBerry About Application\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2<\/p>\r\n<p>When you press any key on the device, the screen will switch to a different screen in the application. This of course makes it hard to switch to a screen capture application and keep the same screen on the display. To take the screen shots within this article, I had to leave the app on the previous screen to the one I wanted to screen capture, use Alt-Escape to switch to the home screen and launch the screen capture utility. The act of switching to another application would cause the About screen to switch so when I came back from launching the screen capture utility, the screen I wanted to capture would be on 'top' of the screen. I think perhaps that RIM needs to fix this, switching applications shouldn't advance the About screen to the next page.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyways, the next screen of the application shows the Java license information as shown in Figure 3. This makes sense since the BlackBerry is a Java device. I like Java and one of the few big disappointments in my professional life is that I never got a chance to do a lot of development in Java (before I moved on to more sales or management roles). Oh well.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2012\/BlackBerry-About3.jpg\" alt=\"BlackBerry About Application\" title=\"BlackBerry About Application\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 3<\/p>\r\n<p>Next came a screen that surprised me. Take a look at Figure 4, it shows a copyright notice from Nuance, the folks that currently own the rights to Dragon Naturally Speaking software. Now, the BlackBerry has had voice recognition capabilities for a very long time – before Android and definitely before iOS. Apparently Nuance provided the software that provided that capability. What's interesting about this is that Nuance is also the software behind the Siri service included with iOS 5.<\/p>\r\n<p>It's interesting that the BlackBerry is running the same software (or a version of it of course) that makes Siri so popular. I tried to use Siri on my iPhone 4 yesterday and with every query I made of the application, it executed a completely different task than I asked it to perform. So much for that.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2012\/BlackBerry-About4.jpg\" alt=\"BlackBerry About Application\" title=\"BlackBerry About Application\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 4<\/p>\r\n<p>Next came a notice from Qualcomm and WebKit. Qualcomm for some part of the Radio and\/or processor chipset and WebKit because the BlackBerry (and every popular smartphone but Windows Phone) uses Apple's WebKit rendering engine to render web pages in the browser.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2012\/BlackBerry-About5.jpg\" alt=\"BlackBerry About Application\" title=\"BlackBerry About Application\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 5<\/p>\r\n<p>The next one surprised me, as shown in Figure 6, the BlackBerry device shows a copyright notice from the Android open source project. Now I know that the BlackBerry PlayBook allows a developer to package an Android application so it will run on the PlayBook, I wasn't aware of the same capability being available on BlackBerry devices. Apparently RIM's doing some work in this area (or something else related to Android) so that's why this notice is in the About Application. It will be interesting to see what RIM does with the Android support.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2012\/BlackBerry-About6.jpg\" alt=\"BlackBerry About Application\" title=\"BlackBerry About Application\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 6<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"2","created":"2012-01-20 13:25:00","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2016-04-13 00:19:11","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2012-01-20 13:25:00","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"6","ordering":"5","metakey":"BlackBerry 7, BlackBerry Device Software, About Application, Nuance, Android","metadesc":"An analysis of the items displayed in the BlackBerry 7 About Application","access":"1","hits":"9341","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"306","asset_id":"329","title":"American Football","alias":"american-football","introtext":"<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>If you know me, you likely know that I'm a big Soccer fan. I regularly irritate my wife by calling American Football...well, you know - American Football. It amazes me that the entire world (except for the United States and possibly Cananda) calls a sport Football but for us in North Americ it means something completely different. That being said, I've been trying to expose my son to the sport so he'll be able to fit in better than I do (wink).<\/p>\r\n<p>So, for the last few years, I've actually tried to pay more attention to the sport. For last year's Super Bowl, I actually knew who was playing before game day - which is something very rare for me. I even watched the whole game and enjoyed it. This year, I took my son on a Carolina Panther Stadium Tour and the next day a friend of ours gave me two excellent tickets to watch a game, so I went.<\/p>\r\n<p>The whole family even sat down the week before last and watched an entire afternoon of Football (there, I didn’t call it American Football – although I wanted to).<\/p>\r\n<p>So, I’m excited for the Super Bowl game on Sunday and I went to the NFL web site (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nfl.com\/\">www.nfl.com<\/a>) to see when the game started. I, of course, was struck by a couple of things I saw there.<\/p>\r\n<p>First of all, today, less than a week before the Super Bowl, I couldn’t find the start time for the game anywhere on the home page. It’s the biggest thing happening in the NFL and nowhere on the home page does it say when the game is being played. Nope, nowhere. That doesn’t make sense. Either they’re clueless, and nobody thought to put the game time on the site (which is unlikely), or their arrogant and assume that the game time is something EVERYONE must know and there’s no reason to put it on the web site.<\/p>\r\n<p>Something else interesting was the advertisement at the top of the site’s home page – shown in the following figure. Help me understand something – why does the NFL need to sell advertisements on their home page? The site is likely hugely popular and they get a gazillion dollars from their licensed products, why would they need advertisements? It makes no sense – they’re a huge brand and can stand alone on their brand. Why would they possibly need ad revenue? Are things that tough at the NFL?<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2012\/nfl.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>One of the things that bothers me is that on sports related sites, when you see a game time posted, in most cases, it’s the start of the television Pregame activities, not the actual game time shown. I was planning on watching the Women’s World Cup Final last year and was an hour off because of this – I dutifully sat down in front of the TV at the specified time only to find out that the game started an hour later. I had a plane to catch, so I ended up watching the whole game from a bar at the airport.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2012-01-30 12:29:38","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2012-01-30 12:29:38","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"2","ordering":"93","metakey":"NFL, American Football, Super Bowl","metadesc":"Weirdness on the NFL home page","access":"1","hits":"8239","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

{"id":"308","asset_id":"331","title":"PhoneGap & Samsung bada","alias":"phonegap-a-samsung-bada","introtext":"<p>While working on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.phonegapessentials.com\">PhoneGap Essentials<\/a>, I got a chance to work with some mobile device platforms I’d not worked with before.&nbsp; I did some work with webOS, but as soon as I got ready to write the chapter on webOS development for PhoneGap, HP announced it was killing the platform and the PhoneGap team added support for Windows Phone development. So, I whacked the webOS chapter and cheerfully replaced it with one on Windows Phone.<\/p>\r\n<p>Another interesting one is Samsung bada, a ‘newer’ OS supposedly getting some traction in Europe and Asia. I covered the OS in <em>PhoneGap Essentials<\/em>, but since then Samsung’s thrown their hat in with another mobile platform called Tizen (ww.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tizen). There’s been some talk of backwards compatibility for bada applications in Tizen, so you should be OK with what you know about PhoneGap and bada.<\/p>\r\n<p>What I learned while working on the bada chapter of the book is that there isn’t any useful information about how to build PhoneGap applications on bada. Not in the PhoneGap download, not on the PhoneGap Google Groups forums, not on the PhoneGap wiki. I’m trying to work through this for the book so the information in the bada chapter is complete, but I thought I’d fill you in on some of the problems today – knowing that they’ll be addressed by the PhoneGap development team as soon as they can. I just wanted to make sure you had this information since I just can’t find real information anywhere.<\/p>\r\n<p>First of all, the PhoneGap download located here: <a href=\"http:\/\/phonegap.com\/download-thankyou\">http:\/\/phonegap.com\/download-thankyou<\/a> doesn’t contain the code you need to build a bada application for PhoneGap. If you download the files from there and extract them on your hard drive then open the readme.md file in the bada folder, you will see something like this:{codecitation class=\"brush:text; gutter:false\"}Steps to build a PhoneGap app<br \/>-----------------------------<br \/>1. Download Source Code (clone the repository)<br \/>2. Import in bada C++ IDE<br \/>3. Put your HTML\/CSS files in the Res\/ folder<br \/>4. Run phonegap.bat under Res\/phonegap directory<br \/>5. Build&amp;Run!{\/codecitation}<\/p>\r\n<p>What this is telling you is that even though there’s PhoneGap source code for creating bada applications in the download you just downloaded, you’ll have to go somewhere else to get the actual code you need. The instructions instruct you to import the sample bada project files into the bada IDE while the bada folder in the standard PhoneGap download doesn’t contain the project files. Instead of using the bada files from the PhoneGap download, you instead need to get them from the Apache Cordova (the latest name for PhoneGap) git repository here: <a href=\"https:\/\/git-wip-us.apache.org\/repos\/asf?p=incubator-cordova-bada.git\">https:\/\/git-wip-us.apache.org\/repos\/asf?p=incubator-cordova-bada.git<\/a>. <br \/>Once you download and extract the files, you’ll have the files you need to import the bada PhoneGap project into the bada IDE.<\/p>\r\n<p>Before you can run the program though, there’s one more step you have to complete and this isn’t documented anywhere either. Open Windows Explorer (the bada stuff only runs on Windows) and navigate to the bada source folder you extracted. Within the Res\/phonegap folder is the phonegap.bat file highlighted in the following figure. You must execute that batch file to generate the phonegap.js file used by the sample application. I don’t understand why you have to take this extra step, there’s no reason I can think of that would prohibit the PhoneGap team from generating this file in advance, but it is what it is.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2012\/phonegap-bada-1.png\" width=\"640\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>If you later make any changes to the JavaScript source files shown in the figure, you can just rerun the batch file to generate a new phonegap.js file from your modified source.<\/p>\r\n<p>At this point you are supposed to be able to fire up the bada IDE, import the project and get to work. At this point, I’ve not been able to make the project build and execute on the bada emulator, but I’m working on it and you’ll find the complete instructions in PhoneGap Essentials when it makes it to print.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you did a quick Google search on PhoneGap and bada, toward the top of the search results should be the link to a PhoneGap bada tutorial here: <a href=\"http:\/\/groups.google.com\/group\/phonegap\/browse_thread\/thread\/ee8dcd9ca0d2d792.\">http:\/\/groups.google.com\/group\/phonegap\/browse_thread\/thread\/ee8dcd9ca0d2d792.<\/a> Unfortunately those instructions didn’t work for me. I followed the instructions to the letter and I got an application, but not one that would use any of the PhoneGap API’s. The tutorial instructs you to build a bada web application to use with the PhoneGap API’s, but if you look at the source code folders in the bada PhoneGap download, you’ll see a bunch of C++ library files – which implies that it’s not a web application, but instead a C++ application that the PhoneGap application runs within. Supposedly there are complete instructions available for how to do this, but I have not been able to get my hands on them. If you know how to make the instructions in this tutorial work, please let me know because I cannot.<\/p>\r\n<p>I’m still working through this and will update you when I have it working.

It's great that they were able to accomplish this, but I'm pretty sure they solved the wrong problem. Instead of doing all of that work to make a hybrid mobile application (a native application built using web technologies) capable of displaying that many records, they should have designed the application so the user would never need to view that many records. Use search or filtering to allow a mobile user to quickly slice and dice the available data options to more quickly get to the data they need - rather than doing rocket science so they can scroll through 4,500 records smoothly.<\/p>\r\n<p>Who cares that the scrolling was jerky and slow - the user should never have (ever) been exposed to that much data at one time anyway.

I had a bunch of ideas and a bunch of different tools I wanted to play with, so I got to work. The cool thing about this was that I wanted to learn these tools, but had so many other things going that I just couldn’t find the time to do it. Fortunately, writing a magazine article about a particular piece of technology is a great way to motivate someone like me to learn the technology.<\/p>\r\n<p>One of the products I’ve always been interested in learning is Rhodes and RhoConnect, two products from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.rhomobile.com\">Rhomobile<\/a> (now part of Motorola Solutions, the other Motorola Company, the one that didn’t get purchased by Google).

I’d poked and prodded at it every so often, but I just couldn’t get my hands around what it was, how it worked and so on. I finally found a book on the subject and on a trip back from the West Coast I read through it and decided I could make it work.<\/p>\r\n<p>Fortunately when previous employer shortened my two week notice and my current employer wasn’t ready for me yet, I created a simple Notes application they set about building the Rhodes application that connected to the database using RhoConnect.

We’re almost done with the book; I just had a few questions to answer. The editor asked me to redo one of the screen shots because it was a little blurry. I dug out the device I used to take the screen shot and setup the shot. The device battery had died, so I plugged it into power so it would charge as I began my test. As I loaded the application and started the video capture application used in the book, the application threw a couple of errors.<\/p>\r\n<p>On this particular device, video capture is disabled when the battery life falls below a certain threshold. This makes sense, but in this case it shouldn’t have mattered since the device was connected to a power source and was charging. Apparently it does.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, that’s not really important, what’s important to me was how the application responded. As I wrote that chapter, I struggled to determine how to cause errors in the video capture process. I could of course cancel the capture and show readers what was returned to the PhoneGap application, but I was looking for real errors and finally found one. The trouble is, the information returned from the PhoneGap application wasn’t enough to help me as a developer understand what had actually happened to cause the failure.<\/p>\r\n<p>Let’s take a look at what I mean.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you take a look at Figure 1, you’ll see a screen capture from the device as soon as I attempted to record video from the application.

Well, with the help of the developer who wrote the bada code for PhoneGap I was able to finally figure it out, get it working and finished the bada chapter for PhoneGap Essentials.<\/p>\r\n<p>First I’m going to complain a little and then I’ll tell you what you need to do to build PhoneGap applications for bada.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Missing Files<\/h2>\r\n<p>In the article I pointed out how the files you needed to build a bada application using PhoneGap weren’t actually in the PhoneGap download. I just checked in the PhoneGap 1.7 release candidate download and they’re still not there. I simply don’t understand it. The development team knows the wrong files are included in the download, but months and months later this particular problem still hasn’t been fixed. How hard can it be to make sure the files you need are packaged into the download? I discussed this with them months ago – you would think this wouldn’t be hard to fix.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Beta<\/h2>\r\n<p>Did you know that support for bada in PhoneGap is considered beta? No, neither did I. The reason the instructions I needed to understand how to build PhoneGap applications for bada were not available is because the PhoneGap project considers (or considered) support for bada to be in beta status. I wish they’d told me that when I started.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Wrong SDK Version<\/h2>\r\n<p>OK, the reason why I&nbsp; (and all of you) couldn’t get the bada stuff to work, even when you had the right files, is that the bada code (still being beta and all) was written for and will only work for an older version of the bada SDK which is no longer available for download. Perhaps I missed this when I started working with this back in August, but I finally see it listed in the readme:<\/p>\r\n<p>DISCLAIMER: THIS IMPLEMENTATION DOES NOT WORK WITH THE BADA 2.x SDK. ONLY 1.2 is supported BY THIS IMPLEMENTATION!<\/p>\r\n<p>So, in order to be able to use this for your bada applications, you will have had to already downloaded this older SDK (before Samsung pulled it from their web site). If you didn’t do that, you’re out of luck.<\/p>\r\n<p>I just noticed too that actual instructions for building bada applications for PhoneGap are now posted to the PhoneGap web site: <a href=\"http:\/\/phonegap.com\/start#bada.\">http:\/\/phonegap.com\/start#bada.<\/a><\/p>\r\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\r\n<p>So, now you know what you need to build bada applications using PhoneGap. As I understand it, the PhoneGap development team is working on an update to the code that will work with the bada 2.x SDK. This will essentially be a complete rewrite since 2.0 does things differently. Once that is done, building bada applications will be easier since you’ll be able to use the latest SDK, support the latest devices and have a simpler process for starting a new app (I hope).<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"14","created":"2012-04-27 12:19:48","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2012-04-27 12:19:48","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"3","ordering":"57","metakey":"PhoneGap, Samsung bada, bada","metadesc":"Finally figured out how to create a PhoneGap application for bada (with help from Nitobi)","access":"1","hits":"7286","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"317","asset_id":"340","title":"BlackBerry World Day 1 Begins","alias":"bbworldday1begins","introtext":"<p>Got up early this morning and made it over to the hotel’s gym. It was nice to get some exercise in before starting my day. When I finished, I decided to walk around a bit just to get my back loosened up. As I walked past the BlackBerry World registration desk, I thought about my registration process and thought I’d write about it.<\/p>\r\n<p>This is my 6th BlackBerry World (or Wireless Enterprise Symposium, WES, as it used to be called), so I knew exactly what to do. I walked toward the registration area, following the signs and walked up to the registration tablets. Of course RIM uses the BlackBerry Playbook for registration, makes sense. Of course, there’s always someone there to make sure you know what you’re doing – as I walked up purposefully to one of the tablets, she asked me ‘You here to register?’&nbsp; I’m not sure what else I’d be doing in the Registration area, but yes.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, as I typed away at the registration process, I truly struggled. For some reason I just couldn’t type my email address (all that’s needed for that part of the registration process). I love my BlackBerry Playbook; I use it all the time. Suddenly I kept mistyping then having to back up and fix the text I just typed. Embarrassing. It wasn’t until I walked past the registration desk this morning that I realized why. The tablets were attached to the table using Velcro! Of course I couldn’t type on them – they’re designed to be held in your hand not strapped to a table. The angle was all wrong. If I’d been able to pick up the tablet and use it like I always use it, I wouldn’t have had problems with the registration process.<\/p>\r\n<p>I understand the need to keep the tablets from walking away, but they should allow me to use the device in the manner in which I’m accustomed. Not force me to use it in an unnatural way.&nbsp; Attach it to the table using some sort of cable; accommodating both left- and right-handed people and you’d have a better experience for registrants.<\/p>\r\n<p>Once the application showed me that my registration had been accepted, it told me to go to badge pickup area B to get my credentials. As I walked away, the handler, the girl watching everyone register, told me I had to click the finish button to finish the registration process. This isn’t critical, but I think this is an application design issue that needs to be addressed.<\/p>\r\n<p>The finish button was a standard web browser button that I’d completely missed because it was too small for fingers. When the application told me to go to badge pickup area B, I immediately attempted to walk away from the station to pick up my credentials. That’s expected behavior, right? Why do I need to click the Finish button? The application knows I’m finished, why not leave the information up there for 15 or 30 seconds or so before moving on to the next screen itself rather than force me to click the button as I leave? Another option would be to put up a ‘Next Registrant’ button or something so that if someone else comes up before the 30-second window had completed (which is highly likely during the first 24 hours of the conference).<\/p>\r\n<p>What they should have done is use up more of the screen real estate for the button, so it’s more easily seen and, very importantly, large enough that the user can easily click it as they’re walking away from the table.

If they’d used a much bigger button, I could just have swiped at it as I was leaving.<\/p>\r\n<p>This is a perfect example of what happens when a developer designs, develops and tests an application outside of the environment where the application will be used. I imagine that if the developer had to test the application while standing up and while the tablet was strapped to a table, that he (or she) would have made some adjustments to the application’s UI before putting it into production.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"2","created":"2012-05-01 12:14:00","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2022-12-04 00:57:37","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2012-05-01 12:14:00","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"2","ordering":"4","metakey":"BlackBerry World, developer","metadesc":"Description of some design issues with the BlackBerry World conference application","access":"1","hits":"8551","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"318","asset_id":"341","title":"What Were They Thinking #12","alias":"wwtt12","introtext":"<h1>The BlackBerry World Application (yet again)<\/h1>\r\n<p>For several years now, I’ve been writing articles for this site that analyze poorly designed mobile applications.&nbsp; It has always amazed me how mobile application developers just don’t seem to think about how their applications would be used and the ‘What were they thinking?’ series of articles was born. It rarely takes me more than a few seconds to see where these applications fail.<\/p>\r\n<p>As I prepared to attend BlackBerry World, I of course downloaded the application for the conference and quickly saw that I would have yet another ‘What were they thinking?’ post centered on the BlackBerry World application.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>It just doesn’t make sense – why do they continue to produce unusable applications for the conference? Isn’t this supposed to be their showcase conference? Isn’t the BlackBerry app for the BlackBerry conference supposed to be the best of the best? Don’t they know how to build cool and useful apps for BlackBerry? They’re BlackBerry, right? The BlackBerry Travel app is amazing, why is the BlackBerry World conference application so…challenged?<\/p>\r\n<p>Let’s take a look at the app. When I first launched the application, I saw what’s shown in Figure 1.<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2012\/bbworld_app_2012_1.png\" alt=\"BlackBerry World Application Screen Shot 1\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>The first thing I noticed was that it appears that the only option available to me is the ‘Share This’ option. All of the other icons appear to be disabled. I seriously spent the 30 seconds or or so trying to figure out why all of the application’s options except for ‘Share This’ were disabled.<\/p>\r\n<p>Taking a hint from Windows or Mac OS, disabled options usually appear without any coloring so users can easily tell which ones are enabled and which are not – just like most of the icons appear on the screen shown in the figure. There’s no shadow or highlighting that would make me believe that those other options were valid. When designing a mobile application, if you’re going to have a bright blue icon and you don’t want your users to think all of the other options are disabled, you have to use color on each and every icon on the screen.&nbsp; The only other option is to use no color at all – for all icons on the screen.<\/p>\r\n<p>This particular effect is even more prominent in the BlackBerry 10 Jam application shown in the figure below. In this example, the icons look even worse. Clearly nothing except for ‘Share This’ is a valid option, right?&nbsp; The dull grey tone of the remaining icons on the screen screams ‘this option is disabled.’<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2012\/bbworld_app_2012_2.png\" alt=\"BlackBerry World Application Screen Shot 2\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2<\/p>\r\n<p>The next thing I noticed in Figure 1 is that this is a browser application (see the ‘mouse’ cursor in the upper-left corner of the screen? The first thing I did was swipe on the device’s touchpad to scroll through the options (the icons) on the screen. No can do, the touchpad does nothing but move the mouse cursor. You can touch the screen to click the icons, but if you use the little optical touch pad, all you can do is move the cursor around on the screen (and click buttons). What an inefficient input mechanism.<\/p>\r\n<p>As a developer, you have access to the touchpad and you could use JavaScript code to take that motion and translate it into something that highlights each icon as you swipe across the touchpad. Even if you didn’t have direct access to the touchpad input, you can still track ‘mouse’ movement and know that the first down motion of the ‘mouse’ should highlight the first icon (sessions) then as the ‘mouse’ moves left\/right\/up\/down, move the highlight to the appropriate icon as needed. Oh, right – there is no highlight, all the developer created were these lackluster icons.<\/p>\r\n<p>Whoever developed this application didn’t take into account users like me who has a BlackBerry Bold and didn’t want to reach all the way up (no, I’m not lazy) and touch the screen when I could simply use the touchpad. You have to accommodate both input mechanisms – touching the screen and using the touchpad. To ignore one and assume the other is poor application design.<\/p>\r\n<p>When you scroll down the page, you see what I’m showing in Figure 3. Why did the developer feel the need to use a background graphic that’s far bigger than what is needed for the application? When you scroll to the bottom of the icon list, it should stop immediately below the last screen element displayed. It should not take up so much additional space on the screen. There’s no need to waste the space like this.<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2012\/bbworld_app_2012_3.jpg\" alt=\"BlackBerry World Application Screen Shot \" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 3<\/p>\r\n<p>Now, I know the developer setup that background image to accommodate all of the icons that appear after you login. But why not show all of the icons, only disabling the ones that are not active – that way, this scrolling issue goes away and with that little extra effort you would have been able to tell that some icons were active and others inactive.<\/p>\r\n<p>All that aside, I can’t seem to use the application since when I start it, I get the following error and I can’t do anything with my schedule.<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2012\/bbworld_app_2012_4.png\" alt=\"BlackBerry World Application Screen Shot 4\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 4<\/p>\r\n<p>On the second day of the conference, RIM released an update to the application, but because I didn’t get around to updating it. However, it doesn’t make sense that you’d need to release a new version of an application in the middle of a three-day window where the application would actually be used. They really should have done more testing. I'm assuming they fixed this particular problem, but I don't know.<\/p>\r\n<p>I’d hoped years ago that this would be obvious, but I guess I’m going to have to say this out loud: What RIM should do is give me an application in advance of the conference and I’ll assess it for ridiculousness as I’ve done in this series. I'll identify the problems, RIM will fix them and all of you will have a better experience and I get to avoid having to write another ‘What were they thinking’ article.<\/p>\r\n<p>It would only take me a minute to point out many of the simple design flaws that exist with each version of the application.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"14","created":"2012-05-09 11:53:18","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-03 20:40:33","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2012-05-09 11:53:18","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_section\":\"\",\"link_section\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_pdf_icon\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"readmore\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"4","ordering":"56","metakey":"RIM, BlackBerry World, BlackBerry 10 Jam, Conference Application","metadesc":"An analysis of the UI Design flaws in the BlackBerry World and BlackBerry 10 Jam conference applications.","access":"1","hits":"6683","metadata":"","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

{"id":"324","asset_id":"362","title":"Joomla Upgrade","alias":"joomla-upgrade-1","introtext":"<p>I’m knee deep into a major upgrade for this site. I’ve been running it on Joomla 1.5 for years now and I thought it was time to get caught up on Joomla versions. Of course, there’s no simple path from Joomla 1.5 to 2.5, so I had to do a migration. There’s a cool migration tool called jUpgrade that essentially copies your existing site to a new folder and migrates all of the content. It worked like a champ and I’m in the process of doing all of the clean-up that has to happen.<\/p>\r\n<p>The biggest reason I’m doing this is to get on the latest version, but to also update the site’s look and organization to bring it in line with other sites of its kind. I’m a big fan of the Joomla templates from JoomlaShack (www.joomlashack.com) and had been using a variable width (full width) template layout, but none of the new, more modern templates from them support that layout. Ugh. So, in order to use one of their new fixed-width templates, I had to whack one of the side bars and move everything into a top menu.<\/p>\r\n<p>I’ve got that finished and now I’m simply working to reenable all of the features of the site. The comments, attachments, code highlighting add-ons I’d been using with my old site are not compatible with Joomla 2.5, so I have to locate an appropriate substitute and get it implemented. Unfortunately on the attachment and code highlighting side, it means that I’m going to have to go and update all existing articles that leverage those features. Not going to be fun.<\/p>\r\n<p>Joomla includes a code highlighting module, but I’ve never been able to find any useful instructions on how to use it.

Oh how things have changed.<\/p>\r\n<p>I’ve had a Windows server here for a very long time – it has 6TB of storage and I use it to backup all of my other systems (I backup my primary Macintosh computer to an AirPort in a different building). I also sync all of my iTunes music (a lot of it and ALL legal) to it, then stream it from the server to my <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sonos.com\" target=\"_blank\">Sonos<\/a> box (I LOVE SONOS!!!) connected to my office stereo.<\/p>\r\n<p>I recently upgraded the home stereo and have really enjoyed RadioIO, Pandora and other music services playing on the stereo. What I miss though is access to my music library. Sometimes you simply want to hear everything you have from a particular artist or listen to a particular CD, and the services my stereo can access don’t support that. I’m waiting for Sonos to add support for Spotify.<\/p>\r\n<p>The new stereo can stream music from a media server, but my Windows Server 2008 box doesn’t include one and I couldn’t figure out how to add it to the server. I downloaded the Wild Media Server, but it wouldn’t let the receiver connect to it no matter what I did and the answer I got from the Wild folks was a recommendation that I not use their software. Crikey!<\/p>\r\n<p>I was thinking of upgrading my server to the latest Microsoft Small Business Server, but instead was reading <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cringely.com\/belt-suspenders-cloud-storage-122387\" target=\"_blank\">Robert X.

{"id":"328","asset_id":"375","title":"Mobile on WordPress","alias":"mobile-on-wordpress","introtext":"<p>I’ve been doing a lot of work in WordPress lately. I’ve always been a fan of the wildly popular, Open Source Content Management System (CMS) but I’ve always thought it was more appropriate for web logs (blogs) than company web sites. Of course, many companies use WordPress for their web sites, and there are even commercial offerings for business customers, so I know it’s common to find business uses for WordPress.<\/p>\r\n<p>This summer I worked with some neighbors who were opening a boutique olive oil and balsamic vinegar store in South Charlotte called Olive This! (www.olivethis.com). As I consulted them about what they wanted to accomplish and their potential skill set, it was clear that WordPress was the way to go for them. I quickly setup a site, populated some menus and got them going. It wasn’t long before they took over the site and now it’s truly a thing of beauty. My only involvement going forward is to provide some occasional support when something weird happens or when they want to add something new to the site and don’t know how.<\/p>\r\n<p>For many years I’ve had a personal, family web site (different from this, my technical blog site). I first set it up when I was learning Joomla and made a Joomla site for the home page. Over time, I picked up WordPress and added it as a sort of blog underneath the Joomla site. Of course, it didn’t take me long to figure out that what I’d done was pretty stupid, having two CMS running essentially the same site made no sense. Unfortunately, it wasn’t until years later (just about a week or so ago) that I decided to whack the Joomla site and move everything to the WordPress site. I did that and I’m really happy with the new site. It’s clean, simple and does exactly what I need it to do.<\/p>\r\n<p>For many years, since the late 1980’s actually, I’ve had this side company called McNelly SoftWorks www.mcnellysoftworks.com. Over the years, I’ve assigned all of my copyrights to the company and done any side work under the company’s name. Back in 2005, after I sold my shares in a Northeastern Ohio-based software and consulting firm, I ran McNelly SoftWorks as a full-time business and even created several commercial software products that are still available for sale today. About that time, I created a web site for the company using NetObjects Fusion – a web site generator that at the time was pretty interesting and cool (to me).<\/p>\r\n<p>One of the long-term items on my to-do list though was to migrate the company’s static web site I created using NetObjects Fusion to something more dynamic. I originally thought I’d create it using Joomla (www.joomla.org) or perhaps Concrete5 (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.concrete5.org\">http:\/\/www.concrete5.org<\/a>), but never got around to doing anything with it. Last week I finally got around to doing something with the site and I’m very happy with the results. The coolest thing, and the primary reason for this post, is that everything I did for the site was automatically mobile device friendly – simply because of the tools I selected to create the site.<\/p>\r\n<p>Let me explain what I mean…<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1 shows the new McNelly SoftWorks web site I launched this weekend. The site was created using WordPress and a very simple and clean template I found called Tiga (<a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/themes\/tiga\">http:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/themes\/tiga<\/a>).<\/p>\r\n<p>As I setup the site, I wanted the company logo and a simple menu at the top and the content filling most of the rest of the page. For the products area, I added a sub-menu which I was very easily able to assign to the right column of the page with the article content listed on the left. Overall, I really loved the simplicity of the site and how clean the UI was. I worked Friday night and Saturday morning on the site and was very happy with the results.<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2012\/mcnelly_softworks_products_page_640.png\" alt=\"McNelly SoftWorks web site\" width=\"640\" height=\"579\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1 – McNelly SoftWorks web site<\/p>\r\n<p>My son had a cub scouts meeting on Friday and as I waited for his meeting to wrap-up I fired up my BlackBerry browser to see how the site looked on the device’s smaller screen. I was very surprised to see that the site was completely mobile friendly and looked amazing on the BlackBerry.&nbsp; Looking back, I noticed that the Tiga template was listed as being mobile friendly – I’d completely missed that when I selected it. Figure 2 shows the site on my BlackBerry Bold 9930 device browser.<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2012\/wordpress%20site%20on%20blackberry%201.png\" alt=\"McNelly SoftWorks Home Page on the BlackBerry Browser\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2 – McNelly SoftWorks Home Page on the BlackBerry Browser<\/p>\r\n<p>On the BlackBerry side, the BES or BIS services pre-process the web content automatically to make it better fit on the smaller BlackBerry screen. In this case, the BES or BIS Service resizes images to fit the screen. That capability coupled with specific settings on the Tiga template made the site simply render beautifully on the BlackBerry. Notice in the figure that the logo has been resized to fit the screen and that the menu is shifted from the right side of the page to directly below the logo.<\/p>\r\n<p>When you open the products page shown in Figure 1, the ‘side’ menu gets added, but because of the limited real estate on the BlackBerry screen, it’s shifted by the template to immediately below the page content as shown in Figure 3.<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2012\/wordpress%20site%20on%20blackberry%202.png\" alt=\"McNelly SoftWorks Products Menu on the BlackBerry Browser\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 3 – McNelly SoftWorks Products Menu on the BlackBerry Browser<\/p>\r\n<p>I tested every aspect of the site on the BlackBerry and it works great – what an excellent way to have both desktop and mobile friendly sites from a single template (without having to resort to the WordPress mobile Plug-in <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/wordpress-mobile-pack\/\">http:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/wordpress-mobile-pack\/<\/a>).<\/p>\r\n<p>For those who would like to see the site on an Android device, take a look at Figure 4.<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2012\/wordpress%20site%20on%20android.png\" alt=\"McNelly SoftWorks Products Menu on an Android Device\" width=\"540\" height=\"960\" \/><br \/>Figure 4 – McNelly SoftWorks Products Menu on an Android Device<\/p>\r\n<p>On an Android Tablet (Nexus 7 in this case), the site looks like what’s shown in Figure 5.<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2012\/wordpress%20site%20on%20android%20tablet.png\" alt=\"McNelly SoftWorks Products Menu on an Android Tablet\" width=\"800\" height=\"1280\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 5 – McNelly SoftWorks Products Menu on an Android Tablet<\/p>\r\n<p>And, of course, for those of you who have to see this on an iOS device, Figure 4 covers that option.<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2012\/wordpress%20site%20on%20ios.png\" alt=\"McNelly SoftWorks Products Menu on an iOS Device\" width=\"368\" height=\"716\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 6 – McNelly SoftWorks Products Menu on an iOS Device<\/p>\r\n<p>Notice that the Android device (my personal Motorola Atrix 2 device) does a slightly better job rendering the content. I’ve always generally felt that Safari is basically a desktop browser running on a smaller screen where the BlackBerry and likely Android browsers are actual mobile browsers. The site’s menu looks much better on the Android device.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, the point of this article was to highlight how I was able to create a mobile friendly WordPress site without doing anything mobile-specific.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"14","created":"2012-12-03 23:27:02","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-12-03 21:43:39","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2012-12-03 23:26:35","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"2","ordering":"50","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"10834","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

{"id":"330","asset_id":"377","title":"Spain's Secret Strike","alias":"spain-s-secret-strike","introtext":"<p>I was in Spain for a conference back in November and I was there during a nationwide strike against the austerity programs that the EU is putting in place to help enable economic recovery. My employer is international (we have offices and employees everywhere) and very organized, so we knew a lot in advance about the strike and were given very specific instructions on how to stay safe during the… unrest.<\/p>\r\n<p>After I’d been in Spain for a day or two, I realized that there was a Secret Strike happening right in front of us. The purpose of this post is to bring information about this secret strike to light so others can learn about it.<\/p>\r\n<p>Spain’s Secret Strike is all about Heat!<\/p>\r\n<p>I’m one of those people who like to stay cool. Being hot, especially too hot for no reason, drives me crazy. I don’t mind making myself hot – through activity or exercise, but being hot simply because someone has the furnace on too high simply demoralizes me.<\/p>\r\n<p>Right about the time of the strikes, all of a sudden everywhere I went&nbsp; the internal temperature in my hotel room and in the conference center was much higher than I found comfortable. When I arrived in Madrid, my hotel room was comfortable and the rooms at the conference center were actually cold (which is surprising).&nbsp; Starting Tuesday, the public strike (not the secret one) was supposed to be on Wednesday, all of a sudden the conference center got much warmer and the same for my hotel room.<\/p>\r\n<p>I asked at the conference desk Tuesday afternoon if it was hot on purpose and I was told no and that they’d been asking repeatedly to have the heat turned down. At this time, it was 26 degrees C (78.8 degrees F) which is mighty uncomfortable when you’re wearing a suit all day. Ugh.<\/p>\r\n<p>That night, my hotel room was hot, too hot for me to sleep. Of course I couldn’t open the windows (locked) so the next morning I politely (or at least I thought it was politely) asked at the front deck if they could make my room a little cooler. When I arrived back in the room that night, it was a balmy 29 degrees C (84.2 degrees F). Ugh – by asking to make my room cooler – they made it unbearably hot.

{"id":"333","asset_id":"381","title":"Big Brother","alias":"big-brother","introtext":"<p>I was reading an article recently on <a title=\"Popular Science Article Link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.popsci.com\/technology\/article\/2012-06\/our-web-videos-reveal-more-we-realize-and-perhaps-more-we-want\">Popular Science<\/a> about an algorithm that can stitch together mobile phone video footage of the same event into a single, synchronized, multi-angle film. Here’s the description from the article:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0.5in 10pt;\">\"As we upload more and more videos to the Internet—one hour of new video every second to YouTube alone—experts are finding new ways to mine them. A team led by Igor Curcio of Nokia’s Research Center, for example, has developed an algorithm that stitches concertgoers’ cellphone footage into a single, synchronized multi-angle film. The concept is relatively simple: the audio track serves as a guide to sync up the footage, and the software chooses the best shots. Curcio has no real business model yet—photography is prohibited at most concerts—but giving people the ability to identify and coherently connect common elements in multiple videos is nonetheless a step toward something significant.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>As I read this article, I thought it was pretty cool. I don’t imagine it’s a very complicated algorithm, assuming that you know the videos are all from the same location (many photos and videos have timestamp and even potentially longitude and latitude information stored with the file), aligning the video streams along the sound track then selecting (whether manually or automatically) the ‘best’ image\/angle to use for a particular time slice shouldn’t be that hard. I imagine that with this technology we’ll start to see some VERY interesting videos produced from all sorts of crowd events.<\/p>\r\n<p>I saw an automobile commercial a while back where the manufacturer had hundreds of folks line up along a car’s route and film the car with their smartphone cameras as it goes by – then stitched the video segments into a short video. Movement along a path with multiple angles I imagine looks pretty cool.<\/p>\r\n<p>Imagine someone arranging this for a concert or even a theatrical presentation – if you can get 10, 20 or 100 people to hold their smartphones up for the entire performance or scene you’ll have a modern, cool format to present the show to others. You could use videos from folks further away from the stage for transitionary segments or slower moving parts of the production or song then ‘zoom in’ to closer cameras for the important stuff. I’d love to see this done more – I bet some innovative folks can do some pretty interesting stuff with this technology.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now, I’m not a paranoid person (although just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean people aren’t out to get you), but the next important part of the article really scared me:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 0.5in;\">\"For instance, the drones that patrol the U.S.-Mexican border and the security cameras in cities already record more footage than human observers can possibly examine. If an agency could rely on a computer to track individuals, groups and events on its own, agents could use intelligence far more—well, intelligibly.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>We’re hearing more and more about law enforcement organizations using social media such as Facebook and Twitter to identify criminals from event images and social media posts. That the technology described in this article could be used for tracking people through a city really scares me. When you think about it though, they don’t need any special algorithms to do this today. Many governments already have the facial recognition software they need and multiple camera angles to pull from to create sophisticated videos from crime scenes. Cameras are everywhere, put there using the paranoia generated by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the US. Assuming someone could coordinate the timestamp of multiple videos (clocks on video recorders are set manually today right? Enabling them to be set via atomic clock would make this easier), we’re not far away from being able to see everyone in a crowd from multiple angles after a terrorist event or serious crime.<\/p>\r\n<p>The good news is that this technology will make it easier to catch criminals and terrorists. The bad news is that these cameras are everywhere and there is very little to keep governments (or even criminals) from watching your every move.

My existing application installations worked great, I simply couldn’t install anything new. I would create a SQL database on my server, FTP the application’s files to a folder on the server then start the installation process only to have it fail. For the Joomla! 2.5 install for example, it would get to a page during the installation process and simply hang.&nbsp; I looked in the server’s error logs and really couldn’t find specifics about what was going wrong.<\/p>\r\n<p>Well, I think I finally found the problem.<\/p>\r\n<p>FatCow had upgraded to PHP 5.3 a while back and I switched my server over to the new version. These applications I was installing were making use of PHP sessions and in my hosting provider’s PHP setup they incorrectly configured the environment. PHP uses a configuration setting called session.save_path to specify the location where the PHP server should place its session data for each user. By default, the variable is configured like this:{codecitation class=\"brush:text; gutter:false\"}session.save_path = \"\/var\/php_sessions\"{\/codecitation}<\/p>\r\n<p>but on my server, that folder was not accessible by me (or apparently the PHP server). So, to fix the problem, I modified the PHP server’s configuration file and pointed the variable to a folder I did have access to (I created a new folder called php_sessions off my server’s root). I ended up with something like the following:{codecitation class=\"brush:text; gutter:false\"}session.save_path = \"\/full_path_to_account_home\/php_sessions\"{\/codecitation}<\/p>\r\n<p>Once I did that, all of a sudden everything started to work.<\/p>\r\n<p>I think perhaps my hosting provider had created a php_sessions folder for my account some time back and I’d deleted it not knowing what it was (something I know you should never do on a server, but sometimes I can’t help myself).

He emailed later asking about the time of the call and I couldn’t figure out why there was confusion – a calendar entry is a calendar entry, right? As long as he accepted the meeting invite, it should be on his calendar, right? Wrong.<\/p>\r\n<p>Of course, those of you who work in Mobile are already thinking you know what happened. He was looking at his calendar on a mobile device and was in a different time zone than the meeting and the mobile device didn’t update accordingly. Well, you’re partially right – he was on a mobile device, but the device OS actually transpired against him. The calendar entry was on his calendar and his mobile device knew which time zone he was in – what happened was that the device actually ignored all of the information it had and deliberately showed the appointment on his calendar at the wrong time.<\/p>\r\n<p>I was in Madrid a while back (at the SAP SAPPHIRE NOW! &amp; TechEd conferences) and was trying to figure out where I was supposed to be. As I looked at my iPad calendar, I saw something similar to what is shown in Figure 1. If you look at the top of the image, you’ll notice that it clearly states that it’s 11:03 AM. Looking at the image, on the right side of the calendar, you’ll notice a red circle and line indicating what time on the calendar I’m working with. Notice the discrepancy? Even though the device knows it’s 11:03 AM, it is forcing the calendar to highlight a completely different time.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Yeah, that’s a feature I want on my mobile device.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2013\/calendar-entry.png\" alt=\"Calendar Entry\" title=\"Calendar Entry\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>Please don’t even get me started on why there are duplicate entries on the calendar – my BlackBerry doesn’t do this, but my iPad does.

He was in a different time zone and his device was telling him that the meeting was at a different time than it actually was.<\/p>\r\n<p>I poked around at this for a while and I finally found the answer. For some bizarre reason, Apple iOS doesn’t show appointments on your calendar at the correct time unless you change one of the settings on the device. Take a look at Figure 2, it shows Calendar settings under the General tab, notice the setting labeled ‘Time Zone Support’? Well, when you turn that setting off, the device shows appointments using the current time zone set on the device.<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000; margin: 5px;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2013\/ios_calendar_settings.png\" alt=\"iOS Calendar Settings\" title=\"iOS Calendar Settings\" height=\"467\" width=\"640\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2<\/p>\r\n<p>This isn’t something I think should be configurable, but apparently Apple does.

{"id":"338","asset_id":"386","title":"Updated Site","alias":"updated-site","introtext":"<p>Well, I finally did it – I completed the site’s upgrade from Joomla! 1.5 to 2.5. I started the project back in August and I haven’t been working on the project the whole time. I just ran into a couple of small, nagging issues and stepped away from it for a while as I worked on other things (like my day job). Of course, Joomla! 3.0 came out in the meantime, so I have to make plans to do that upgrade soon (as 3.0 is way, way cool and implements some features I really want to use on the site).<\/p>\r\n<p>I used a Joomla! extension called JUpgrade to manage the upgrade process. You install it on your site and execute the process and it creates a new folder (under the current site’s folder) and a new set of database tables (with new table prefix) then migrates all of your 1.5 data into the 2.5 format. It is really slick and works really well – especially for a free piece of software created and (I think) maintained by one guy.<\/p>\r\n<p>At the conclusion of the migration, I had two sites – the old one and a relatively stable new one. The next task was to go through EVERYTHING in the new site and make sure it worked. JUpgrade only supports a subset of the Joomla! extensions I was using, so I found an awful lot of places where I had to install an updated version of an extension (I couldn’t in some cases install the upgrade before migrating, because the new version might not be compatible with the old site). I should have gone through and updated everything first, but I think (can’t remember now) I forgot to do that.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyways, I poked and prodded at this thing and finally got almost everything back up and running in a few hours. It was fun and exhilarating work, I don’t know what it was about the task, but I really, really enjoyed it. I guess the prospect of taking a completely new look at the site and its functionality (it’s been up for almost 4 years now) was fun.<\/p>\r\n<p>The ‘old’ site (it was live just a day ago and now it’s old?) used a template from Joomlashack called Weblogic and it was cool in the fact that it used the entire width of the page (which modern Joomla Templates, until very recently, did not do) and because of that I had components on the left and right of the page with content in the middle. As I started this project, none of the Joomla! 2.5 compatible templates I could find supported that. So, I set out to find a new template and selected Simple Tech (also from JoomlaShack); it’s really cool and I love orange. I hired a local design firm to make the logo and I was all set.<\/p>\r\n<p>Since then of course, Joomla! templates have now gone ‘responsive’ and can again make use of most of a page’s width. I’m waiting for the folks at JoomlaShack to upgrade Simple Tech to use the responsive layout, but for now you (and I) are stuck with the 960 layout popular these last few years (ugh).<\/p>\r\n<p>So, what held me back? Getting CodeCitation to work. When I first built the site, I quickly found myself needing to be able to highlight application source code in a neat way on the site. I found that the Joomla! project team had implemented a syntax highlighter called GeSHi – but I couldn’t find information about how to use it ANYWHERE. Even the GeSHi site only shows you how to implement GeSHi, not use it. So, I went searching and found a plug-in called CodeCitation that was free, worked and was documented at least well enough that I could get started. So, after the upgrade, I went looking for an updated version of the CodeCitation&nbsp; plug-in and couldn’t find one. The last version was only compatible with Joomla! 1.6. I installed that version and quickly learned that I still had the same problem. When you loaded pages that had source code highlighted, you’d get an error when the page loaded. I located the plug-in’s author and emailed him – he was kind enough to respond, but was ‘planning’ on updating the plug-in but had no timeline in mind. Crikey.<\/p>\r\n<p>I thought about switching to the built-in GsSHi, which was now better documented – I at least knew better how to use it, but that would take a lot of work. The CodeCitation developer was responsive, but didn’t have a lot to say – clearly he’s moved on to other things.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, I put everything down and stepped away for a while. Of course, life happens and holidays too, so it was not until a couple of days ago that I picked it back up again (about 5months later). I started really looking at the content, trying to figure out why the plug-in was failing. I quickly learned that only some of the pages were generating errors, the plug-in worked on some articles, but not all. Of course, then I started looking at the differences between the articles that worked and the ones that didn’t – and found the problem. It was my fault all along!<\/p>\r\n<p>CodeCitation uses some markup you add to your content to identify the areas that you want it to manipulate. In that markup, you add a class element and identify the brush you want to use (language) to markup the content as shown below. {codecitation class=\"brush:text; gutter:false\"}class=\"brush:vb; gutter:false\"{\/codecitation}In this example, the brush is set to vb (for Visual Basic). Notice the semicolon between the 'brush' and 'gutter' attributes? Well, in the articles I was having trouble with, I’d forgotten to include the semicolon separator between those two elements.

David Via is a long time friend (a really, really long time) and a really smart guy. Enjoy!<\/p>\r\n<p>By David Via<\/p>\r\n<p>I was conducting a ride along activity today when I was struck by a remarkable idea.&nbsp; Could it some day soon make sense for some mobile professionals to carry *two* tablet devices?<\/p>\r\n<p>Let me backtrack just a bit.&nbsp; A ride along is when I shadow a mobile employee of a large enterprise in his daily activities to help identify ways in which they might realize benefit from mobile applications.&nbsp; Today I was riding along with a sales person.&nbsp; In case you have been living under a rock for the past two years, sales people absolutely LOVE mobile tablets.&nbsp; I have heard tablets (OK, specifically the iPad) referred to as \"the greatest sales tool ever invented\".&nbsp; Tablets are an ideal platform for mobile sales professionals. They are small, light and fast. They encourage interaction and collaboration with a customer over an intimate on screen experience.&nbsp; Quite the opposite experience of opening up a notebook computer in a customer meeting in which the flipping open of the screen essentially creates a \"wall\" between the seller and the his prospect.&nbsp; Tablets are equally terrific for presenting content and quickly capturing information on the fly.<\/p>\r\n<p>And therein lies the problem.<\/p>\r\n<p>While I was observing the sales interactions on my ride along today, I found myself in a dilemma.&nbsp; Where would mobile applications on a tablet have the greatest impact?&nbsp; Facing the customer or facing the seller?&nbsp; Certainly both have a lot of value.&nbsp; A highly interactive presentation - think 3D walkthroughs or detailed product models -&nbsp; on a tablet could augment the sellers' knowledge and presentation.&nbsp; At the same time a true sales force *enablemment* tool on a tablet - here a guided selling tool comes to mind, or other job aid that truly supports the seller, not the type of management-driven data gathering that traditional CRM or SFA tools sometimes turns out to be - would really help the sales person to perform better in their day to day role.<\/p>\r\n<p>But we only have one tablet, right?&nbsp; So maybe we just need to get another tablet.<\/p>\r\n<p>It sounds crazy at first, but is it?&nbsp; I have run into this dilemma myself in my role as a frequent presenter.&nbsp; I'm often asked why I present slides from my Macbook and not from my iPad.&nbsp; The simple answer is that I rely on my iPad to take notes and there's really no way to use one tablet screen to do both.<\/p>\r\n<p>Prices are falling and so are device sizes and weights.&nbsp; Even in today's market two tablets cost and weigh less than the tablet and notebook combo that many of us travel with to customer meetings.<\/p>\r\n<p>So maybe the ideal technology travel combo of 2015 will be two tablet devices and zero notebook computers?<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"36","created":"2013-01-25 22:06:51","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2013-01-28 23:12:07","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2013-01-25 22:06:51","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/2013\\\/tablet-customer.png\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/2013\\\/tablet-customer.png\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":null,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":null,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":null,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"7","ordering":"0","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"7959","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"341","asset_id":"392","title":"Discovering Raspberry Pi","alias":"discovering-raspberry-pi","introtext":"<p>Many months ago I learned about the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.raspberrypi.org\">Raspberry Pi<\/a> hobbyist computer. Apparently it was created to provide an inexpensive system that kids could use to learn programming. At $35US it really hits the mark.<\/p>\r\n<p>I understand their goals well; I had access to micro computers in High School back in the late 70’s, at home at about the same time and in college as well. The reason I’m a computer developer is because I was able to be one so early in life and it definitely stuck. My first computer was a Ti Ti-99-4a and the second was a tricked out Apple \/\/e that I kept for many, many years. I spent a ton of time writing code for those boxes and that quite possibly have something to do with why it took me so long to get married. That’s a story for another time.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, I was excited about the potential for the Pi, so I ordered one and it sat in a box for a while. My 9 year old son and I got a chance to hook it up yesterday afternoon and had a blast. If you haven’t seen one before, here’s a picture.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2013\/raspberry-pi.png\" alt=\"Raspberry PI\" title=\"Raspberry PI\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>Essentially it’s a mini-PC with an ARM processor, HDMI port, Ethernet Port, two USB ports and some more stuff. It runs on a cell phone charger (I’m using a BlackBerry charger in the photo). You burn a special version of Linux to an appropriately sized (2GB minimum) SD card, plug everything in and you’re ready to go.<\/p>\r\n<p>When it fires up,&nbsp; you get the standard linux command prompt and can interact with the device through the command prompt or you can start an X-Windows UI environment. The default Raspberry Pi Linux image (Raspbian – a Raspberry Pi version of Debian) has a bunch of software included, including some Integrated Development Environments (IDE) for Python (the Pi in the Raspberry Pi name) and Scratch (a drag and drop development environment for kids).<\/p>\r\n<p>I’m not going to go into all of the details here, there’s some good books on the subject (I’ve read two) and a bunch of information available online. It’s really easy to setup and to use. Knowing a little bit about Linux makes it a little easier, but not much. My son and I fired up the Scratch IDE and using an example from the O’Reilly book on the subject created an alien shooter game in an hour and had a blast doing so. My son’s learning a little bit about computer programming, we’ve already added some enhancements to game and have more planned. Here’s a picture of my son working on the latest version of his game.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2013\/son-with raspberry-pi.png\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>Figure 2<\/p>\r\n<p>I ordered a few 8 GB SD cards yesterday. I’m going to set one up for my daughter so she can work with Scratch in her own environment. I have a 32 GB card I’m going to use as my personal playground – along with the default debian distro, there are Fedora and other Linux distributions available for the Pi, so I’m going to give them a try.<\/p>\r\n<p>There’s also a XBMC Media Center distro for the Pi (<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.xbmc.org\/index.php?title=Raspberry_Pi\">http:\/\/wiki.xbmc.org\/index.php?title=Raspberry_Pi<\/a>) that I’m going to download and play with. I’m a HUGE fan of the Sonos players, but I’m going to see if I can setup the Pi in my living room and pull my (legally obtained) music from my Windows server.&nbsp; I’ll probably write about that here later.<\/p>\r\n<p>Next on my list of things to play with is the Arduino, an open source, programmable microcontroller. I’m not much of an electronics guy, but I truly want to be one. I imagine a programmed microcontroller in a pumpkin sitting on my front porch at Halloween.&nbsp; Also, my son and I have some interesting ideas about what we want to do with his Pinewood Derby car next year.<\/p>\r\n<p>A neighbor geek like me recently told me about the TI MSP430 micro controllers that compete with the Arduino device. At less than $5 per device I’ve ordered some of them and I’m going to play around with them (with my son of course) when they get here.<\/p>\r\n<p>What this means, of course, is that I now have more to write about here.

{"id":"343","asset_id":"394","title":"Switching Development from Smartphones to Tablets","alias":"switching-development-from-smartphones-to-tablets","introtext":"<div class=\"note INFO\">Note: this is a copy of an article I posted to my SAP Community Network (SCN) blog at <a href=\"http:\/\/scn.sap.com\/blogs\/johnwargo\">http:\/\/scn.sap.com\/blogs\/johnwargo<\/a>.<\/div>\r\n<p>Many years ago, one of the struggles enterprise-focused mobile device manufacturers, wireless carriers and mobile development tool vendors faced was getting companies to make an investment in building mobile applications for their employees. As we all know, with the introduction of the iPhone and Android plus the effectiveness of the “There’s an app for that” campaign, it’s become less of an issue. BYOD has put a business-connected smartphone in a lot of hands and organizations have built many mobile apps in order to create efficiencies for that mobile workforce.<\/p>\r\n<p>In some recent conversations with customers though, I’ve learned that many organizations are building fewer smartphone apps and more tablet apps for their mobile users. That revelation didn’t really surprise me, but I didn’t expect we’d get to this point so quickly. I think however that several factors are affecting this trend:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Building for tablets allows organizations to focus on a reduced number of mobile devices (and configurations) to support. The folks at RIM got hammered for a long time because developers had to support so many different form factors\/screen resolutions over the years. The same thing has been affecting Android developers for a long time and of course is now affecting iOS developers as well, although not as much. There’s still a lot of variance in tablet form factors, but with the larger available work area (discussed in the next point) developers simply don’t have to work as hard to create a compelling and useful UI for their applications.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The larger work area available on tablets allows an organization to fit much more information on the screen, which will ultimately help users of these applications be more effective with the application and be able to work with much more data at the same time. With the way the human brain works, when doing analysis of sales data or other important business information, being able to see as much data as possible at once makes it easier to ‘work’ with the data.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The way a user interacts with a tablet application vs. the same smartphone application is different – there are operational efficiencies inherent in tablet applications simply because of the amount of information that can be displayed on the screen at one time. Reducing the number of touches and swipes a user has to perform to access all of the information they need to make a business decision has to make tablet applications ‘easier’ to use.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Developers of tablet applications have potentially more flexibility in their UI designs. For some reason, there seems to be less of a requirement that tablet applications look like other applications running on the device. With smartphone apps, and developers bound by Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines (HIG - <a href=\"http:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/ios\/#documentation\/userexperience\/conceptual\/mobilehig\/Introduction\/Introduction.html\">http:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/ios\/#documentation\/userexperience\/conceptual\/mobilehig\/Introduction\/Introduction.html<\/a>), there is a propensity for apps to all work in a similar way. Developers building many of the tablet applications that I’ve worked with don’t seem to be encumbered by that particular restriction.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>The thing about tablets vs. smartphones is that on top of everything else they do, tablets seem to be more of a presentation tool than smartphones. What this means then is that organizations that provide tablets should:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Equip their employees with tablets with greater memory capacity. I’d always had 16GB tablets until I joined SAP and found myself with a 32GB tablet in my hand. SAP enables its employees with a lot of mobile apps (mostly tablet apps), but at the same time provides tools which allow me to maintain a repository of my important documents on my device (see the following point) – which quickly consumes that extra memory.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Build a mechanism which allows employees to easily load employee specific documents and files on the tablet. This includes custom sales presentations, customer background information and more.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Build a mechanism which allows IT to easily distribute important sales and training materials onto employee devices.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>This becomes very important with sales-focused positions – where every sales person for example needs to have the latest and greatest product videos available at all times to show to customers.<\/p>\r\n<p>In my opinion, mobile operating systems need to allow for deeper integration between applications and the device OS – but that’s a topic we’ll discuss in my next post. Stay tuned.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"14","created":"2013-02-01 13:19:35","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2013-02-01 13:23:23","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2013-02-01 13:19:35","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":null,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":null,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":null,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"4","ordering":"49","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"8056","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"344","asset_id":"395","title":"The Value of App\/OS integration to an Enterprise","alias":"the-value-of-app-os-integration-to-an-enterprise","introtext":"<div class=\"note INFO\">Note: this is a copy of an article I posted to my SAP Community Network (SCN) blog at <a href=\"http:\/\/scn.sap.com\/blogs\/johnwargo\">http:\/\/scn.sap.com\/blogs\/johnwargo<\/a>.<\/div>\r\n<p>I mentioned in my previous post, it seems that a lot of organizations are thinking more lately about tablet development than smartphone development. Many customers have also told us that they’re looking seriously at Windows 8; that got me thinking about what makes Windows 8 interesting to those organizations. Now, many of you immediately started thinking about the enterprise features of Windows 8 such as the ones described in Eric Lai’s post on the subject (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/in-the-enterprise-windows-8-tablets-may-zoom-past-pcs-7000006456\">http:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/in-the-enterprise-windows-8-tablets-may-zoom-past-pcs-7000006456<\/a>). On the other hand, I’m a developer, so I immediately started thinking of the value Windows 8 tablets had in the enterprise and that got me thinking about how well applications can interact with the device OS (whether it be smartphones or tablets) and what that means to enterprise users. Of course, SAP has already announced six enterprise applications for Windows 8 – you can read more information about those apps here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/sap-to-offer-six-enterprise-enhanced-windows-8-apps-7000007310\/.\">http:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/sap-to-offer-six-enterprise-enhanced-windows-8-apps-7000007310\/.<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p>It seems to me that one of the ways an organization increases the benefit of a mobile device is through the ways it exposes important business data to the mobile user and the ways that the mobile user can interact with the data.<\/p>\r\n<p>The market has already shown us that the iOS device is mighty popular with enterprises and Apple, through its periodic updates to the OS, has been adding features for the enterprise over time. They’ve still got a while to go to catch up with the enterprise features of the BlackBerry platform, but the value is definitely there. iOS device users have their mail, calendar, and (finally) tasks on their device, plus the personal and any enterprise applications they need. What the OS doesn’t have though is app to app or app to OS integration that could make the device more useful to enterprise users. Apple has (for security and performance reasons I imagine) deliberately restricted how an application can interact with other apps on the device and there’s very little (if any) visible integration with the device OS. iOS applications can pass data to other applications, but seamless integration is…limited.<\/p>\r\n<p>From early on, the Android OS has supported widgets, which allow a developer to create an application that renders data directly on the device’s home screen. We have seen examples of this in the weather widget found on any Android phone or the Facebook widget that shows the latest entries on a user’s timeline. For the enterprise user, there’s real value in using this concept to render enterprise data as well. Imagine an enterprise sales application that exposes a portion of the application’s UI as a widget; the widget could change the background color and\/or the content rendered within the widget’s UI depending on user-specified criteria. When certain customers report critical issues, change the background to yellow (or red as appropriate) and list the customer names or project names for example, allowing the user to immediately understand the status of the customer(s) without even opening the app. The user unlocks the device and can immediately see what’s going on – clicking on the widget to open the app and viewing the details.<\/p>\r\n<p>The BlackBerry platform has had something like this for many years – using the push capabilities of the BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) or even the PushMarks service for BlackBerry Internet Service (BIS) a back-end application can send data to a mobile application running on the BlackBerry and change the application’s icon to indicate some sort of status. Developers would build apps that changed the icon color to indicate status (yellow for warning, or red for critical for example) or even add some sort of numerical indicator to the icon. The user looks at the device screen and immediately knows that something needs their attention.<\/p>\r\n<p>BlackBerry 10 is supposed to make inter-app integration mainstream through its BlackBerry Hub as described in Paul Mah’s recent article (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/blackberry-10-is-about-integration-usability-7000008202\/\">http:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/blackberry-10-is-about-integration-usability-7000008202\/<\/a>). I’m still waiting for a chance to play with this feature, but with RIM’s multi-threaded OS (where unlike iOS, apps are encouraged to work in the background) and the Hub, the user simply swipes to see the notifications area and all of the things that require his or her attention are listed there. It will be easy then for an enterprise application to notify the user any time critical data is available – right in the place where the user will already be going to for email, calendar notices and more. Knowing the BlackBerry developer community like I do, I’m sure a lot of developers, especially enterprise developers, are going to make good use of this integration.<\/p>\r\n<p>On Android, the widget is the app – what you create is the application UI and the OS allows you to display the app on a subset of the device’s screen (attached to one of the home screen pages available to users). With Windows 8, this is different and likely more useful to enterprise developers. In Windows 8 applications, Microsoft has exposed an API which allows a developer to write data to the application’s tile on the device’s home screen. On Windows 8, tiles are application ‘icons’ that can be dragged around and positioned on the device home screen. Tiles can be big or they can be small, and the user can put them wherever she or he wants. Developers can use this capability to expose critical data from the application directly to the home screen – without needing a separate widget UI. In this example, the application’s tile tells the user about what’s going on within the application.<\/p>\r\n<p>There’s risk in this of course, password protected enterprise applications protect the contents within an application – and exposing app data through the tile exposes data around that protection. Any enterprise device should have a password assigned to it anyway – most IT departments have figured that out by now, right?<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"14","created":"2013-02-01 13:23:01","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2013-02-17 00:57:39","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2013-02-05 13:22:29","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":null,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":null,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":null,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"5","ordering":"48","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"7554","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"345","asset_id":"396","title":"Too Many Eclipse Instances","alias":"too-many-eclipse-instances","introtext":"<p>I’ve been doing some more mobile development lately – building some applications on the SAP Mobile platform (what was formerly known as the Sybase Unwired Platform) and therefore cranking up some development environments for Android, BlackBerry and even iOS. In preparation for this work, I was updating my Eclipse instance on my Mac Mini plus creating a new Windows VM with Eclipse and all of the tools I needed. One of the things I noticed is that the whole concept of Eclipse plug-ins is essentially broken when it comes to mobile development.<\/p>\r\n<p>Let me explain…<\/p>\r\n<p>The Android development tools embraced Eclipse early on and worked very hard to make sure their stuff simply ran on most any version of Eclipse out there. There were some initial incompatibilities with the Java 7 SDK, but that’s to be expected with a big version upgrade for an underlying technology like Java, and although the Android SDK installer wanted to install its files in the Windows Program Files folder, that rarely worked. At the end of the day though, the Android SDK fit nicely into most any version of Eclipse.<\/p>\r\n<p>I just downloaded the latest version of the Android SDK and noticed that the installer was gone (not sure I’m really a fan of that) and there was a new folder included in the download with a complete instance of Eclipse. OK, so Google’s now telling us that they suggest that you do your Android development with their instance of the Eclipse IDE.<\/p>\r\n<p>The BlackBerry Java SDK is fickle, very fickle. Even though the Android DSK has embraced most any version of Eclipse, with the BlackBerry Java SDK, it supports only Eclipse version 3.7 (<a href=\"https:\/\/developer.blackberry.com\/java\/download\/requirements\/\">https:\/\/developer.blackberry.com\/java\/download\/requirements\/<\/a>). That wouldn’t be that bad, except that 3.7 is pretty old. So, imagine you’re using the latest and greatest Eclipse stuff to do Android or some other development, you’re going to have to maintain a completely separate, older version of Eclipse simply for BlackBerry development.<\/p>\r\n<p>Here’s some screen shots of what you get when you successfully install then try to run the BlackBerry Java development SDK in a current version of Eclipse.<\/p>\r\n<p>{gallery}2013\/eclipse1{\/gallery}<\/p>\r\n<p>What was particularly maddening about this particular problem was that the error messages about the pre-processor configuration are cyclical, the one message appears, then you’re prompted to restart Eclipse then the error message appears, then you’re prompted to restart Eclipse. It never ends.<br \/>Notice too the error messages about missing a DLL? Unfortunately, that error was generated on a Macintosh – not sure there’s a lot of DLLs on a Mac.<\/p>\r\n<p>The IBM Worklight developer tools have similar restrictions – I downloaded the trial last year and was having fits trying to get it to work. I expect everything to be like the Android tools – simply work in most any version of Eclipse, but after struggling with the Worklight plug-in installation, I finally looked at the system requirements and noticed it too only supported an older version of Eclipse.<\/p>\r\n<p>The SAP Mobile Platform (SMP) tooling uses Eclipse 3.7, so it’s really easy to setup BlackBerry and Android Java development environments within the SMP development tools. At the end of the day though, you’re still setting up a separate environment just for SMP development – and adding yet another Android instance to your configuration if you want to do both Android and BlackBerry development in the same IDE where you’re doing your SMP development. I would be happier though if SMP was a plug-in as well, rather than a complete IDE installation like it is today.<\/p>\r\n<p>The moral of the story is that it simply shouldn’t be this hard! Google’s making the investment to make their stuff work in most any version of Eclipse – how hard can that be? RIM (now called BlackBerry) and IBM I imagine have to have similar sized development teams, why can’t they build Eclipse plug-ins that just work? Granted BlackBerry has been really busy with BlackBerry 10, and has essentially abandoned Java development, you’d think they would want to make things simple for their developer community.<\/p>\r\n<p>With so many of the mobile development vendors supporting restricted versions of Eclipse, developers can’t truly benefit from the plug-in capabilities of Eclipse. Either Eclipse has made making compatible plug-ins too hard or these mobile development tool vendors or the vendors are simply not trying hard enough. I’ve never built an Eclipse plug-in, so I really can’t say. At the end of the day though, what’s the value of an IDE with a plug-in architecture if I still have to install and maintain separate instances of the IDE just to use different plug-ins?<\/p>\r\n<p>If you’re not going to do that – at least make the system requirements more visible so that people like me who don’t go looking for the system requirement before installing an Eclipse plug-in can know that what they’re trying to do won’t work. Why not include the supported eclipse version in the plug-in name?<\/p>\r\n<p>Better yet, why not simply include version checking into the plug-in installation process? Let me know during installation that the plug-in is not compatible with the version of Eclipse I’m running? That would seem to make sense – why let me install something that you know is not going to work?<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"14","created":"2013-02-04 13:29:49","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2013-02-04 13:34:17","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2013-02-04 13:29:49","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/2013\\\/eclipse_bckgr_logo_fc_med-160.png\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/2013\\\/eclipse_bckgr_logo_fc_med-160.png\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":null,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":null,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":null,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"4","ordering":"47","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"9068","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"346","asset_id":"397","title":"Carrier APIs","alias":"carrier-apis","introtext":"<p>I have to admit that I simply don’t get Carrier-specific APIs. I used to work for RIM (now called BlackBerry), working with their largest carrier and later on worked at that same carrier. I know how desperately the wireless carriers don’t want to simply be a pipe (provide me with network access) – but instead want have all sorts of value-add products they can sell you. At the end of the day, all I want them to be is a pipe and I’d gladly pay them more money per month if they’d simply give me a wireless network connection for my devices and let me use them any way that I want to.<\/p>\r\n<p>I know it costs a lot of money to create and maintain the wireless networks, and I know that some users use more bandwidth than others (iOS users vs. BlackBerry users for example), so just go ahead and charge me based upon how I use your network.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, I was at the AT&amp;T Dev Summit last month and saw some interesting things there. AT&amp;T has been working with Sencha and others to create a suite of APIs that mobile app developers can use in their applications. There’s some pretty interesting location based services (LBS) APIs available, plus services around SMS, billing and so on that could be pretty useful for mobile developers.<\/p>\r\n<p>The problem is that these APIs are available from a specific carrier (the LBS APIs are a global product, available for most carrier’s devices, but in this case AT&amp;T has their own ‘branded’ version of the service). If I’m building a mobile application, I don’t benefit from leveraging APIs that are usable for only a subset of my available customers. If I’m going to build functionality in my application, I have to be able to use it over all customer devices – having to implement a different system depending on which carrier a customer is on is inefficient and too expensive to implement for many smaller development shops.<\/p>\r\n<p>In the Dev Summit keynote, one of AT&amp;T’s partners demonstrated an application which allowed an application to type in their phone number then the application retrieved the mobile user’s account information from the carrier.&nbsp; If you know all of your customers are on AT&amp;T, then the API is useful, but I expect that the number of cases where that is true is…zero. That makes that particular API pretty much useless. On top of that, the demo included the user typing in their phone number, why? They were showing a native application running on the iPhone; native applications know (with the appropriate permissions of course) what the device’s phone number is. How are you helping me if I need to type in my phone number before you retrieve my account information from the carrier?<\/p>\r\n<p>Use the local API to determine the device’s phone number then populate the rest of the form with the data from the carrier. I imagine they did it that way to demonstrate that all that was needed was the phone number in order to populate the entire form, but it was a silly demo.<\/p>\r\n<p>What’s needed is a common, cross-device, cross-carrier on device app and API that allows a user to define common information about themselves (name, address, phone number, credit cards) then make it available to any application that asks for it (with the appropriate approval of the user of course). Then, when I get the device, I enter in all of that information once then any app I authorize can access that information. If I don’t authorize it, there is no reason the local API couldn’t simply prompt the user for authorization when needed. That would be a much easier system for mobile developers to implement and much less work for the mobile user. Everyone wins and there’s no need for cloud-based, carrier-specific APIs.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"15","created":"2013-02-07 12:57:37","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2013-02-07 12:59:04","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2013-02-07 12:57:37","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":null,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":null,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":null,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"2","ordering":"13","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"8881","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

{"id":"348","asset_id":"399","title":"Using jUpgrade","alias":"using-jupgrade","introtext":"<p>I’ve upgraded a few sites lately from Joomla! 1.5 to Joomla! 2.5 using <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/extensions.joomla.org\/extensions\/migration-a-conversion\/joomla-migration\/11658\">jUpgrade<\/a>. The upgrade from 1.5 to 2.5 isn’t exactly an upgrade, it’s more of a migration, so you really have to use tools like jUpgrade to make it work.<\/p>\r\n<p>JUpgrade installs as a Joomla! Component and adds its own options to the Joomla! Components&nbsp; menu. It essentially downloads a version of Joomla! 2.5, installs it in a sub-folder from your original Joomla! 1.5 installation then copies ‘all’ of your stuff to the new site. At the end of the rather quick and painless process, you have two copies of your Joomla! site; one in the site’s original location and another in a sub-folder called ‘jupgrade’. You maintain access to your original site, but have this new version to work with to test to make sure everything migrated OK (it didn’t, trust me) and to upgrade your template, extensions and so on. Chances are your Joomla! 1.5 template won’t be compatible with Joomla! 2.5, so no matter what, you’ll have to acquire, install and configure an updated template in your upgraded (migrated) web site.<\/p>\r\n<p>You may have noticed that I said above that everything won’t migrate correctly – that wasn’t a complaint, simply a statement of the truth. jUpgrade is amazing considering what it does and how much it costs (it’s free). Unfortunately, there’s so many plug-ins, components and modules available for Joomla! that there’s no way for any migration tool to be able to accommodate everything which might be running in your site.<\/p>\r\n<p>The developer(s) of jUpgrade have done what they can to accommodate the most popular options, but after the conclusion of the jUpgrade migration, you’ll have all of your articles, categories and menus copied over into the new site, but not much else. When you go into the new version of the site, you’ll have to start adding back your extensions and putting everything back where it belongs. It’s a challenging task, but I found it to be a fun process. It forces you a chance to rethink your site’s structure, layout and configuration – and ultimately my ‘new’ sites look nothing like my original sites when I’m done.<\/p>\r\n<h1>What Didn’t Work<\/h1>\r\n<p>Having migrated three sites, I thought I’d fill you in on some of the things that simply did not migrate properly using jUpgrade.<\/p>\r\n<p>Categories<\/p>\r\n<p>The first thing I noticed was that Joomla! article categories got copied over to the new site, but didn’t work correctly. In some cases, I had to go in and edit then save each category before things would work correctly. In other cases I found that my top level categories were setup as sub-categories to the Uncategorized category. Either way, expect that you’re going to have to do some work on your categories before you can go live with your migrated site.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Newsfeeds<\/h2>\r\n<p>I also noticed that on several of my migrated sites, any Newsflash Module settings don’t make it across correctly. In several of my sites, I had a newsflash module rendering a random article on part of the site. After the migration, that module was still there, but was configured to show many articles in a particular order – rather than the one article with random as I originally had it setup.<\/p>\r\n<h2>SH404SEF<\/h2>\r\n<p>I use the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/anything-digital.com\/sh404sef\/seo-analytics-and-security-for-joomla.html\">SH404SEF<\/a> SEO, analytics and security module from Anything Digital on several of my sites. I noticed that during the jUpgrade migration process, something goes wrong and SH404SEF stops working correctly. For this site, I’ve not been able to resolve the issues I have – even with support from Anything Digital. If you look at links on this site, you’ll notice that I have the external link symbol appearing to let you, my readers, know when I’m sending you somewhere else. It’s a feature of the SH404SEF component and I like it. If you look at some of the articles that precede this one on the site, you’ll notice that some links (but not all) that point to external sites have the symbol but not others. I can’t figure it out nor can I fix it.<\/p>\r\n<p>Recommendation is to completely uninstall SH404SEF before starting the migration, and then reinstall it later. I’m not sure it that will help, but it’s worth a try.<\/p>\r\n<h1>Going Live<\/h1>\r\n<p>After you’ve completed the migration process and made sure everything is working well on your new site, migrating from the old site to the new one is quite painless. Simply delete the old site’s files (I download them first, then copy them to another folder on my server – can’t have too many copies) then copy the files from the jupgrade folder to the original site’s folder. With that done, you’re all set – just be sure to test everything before you decide you’re done.<\/p>\r\n<p>After you’ve made sure everything is working OK, go into your MySQL manager and open your site’s database – you’ll find two sets of tables there, your original Joomla! tables plus a new set created by jUpgrade. It’s not required, but you will want to remove (drop) the original tables when you’re sure the new site’s working as expected.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"8","created":"2013-02-17 23:37:47","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2013-02-17 23:40:01","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2013-02-17 23:37:47","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":null,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":null,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":null,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"3","ordering":"6","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"9171","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

I quickly gave up on GeSHi and started looking elsewhere.<\/p>\r\n<p>In the Joomla! extension directory, I found another plug-in called Code Citation which seemed to be exactly what I was looking for. It was a standard Joomla! plug-in, so it was installed in no time, and there was actually documentation on how to use it in your Joomla! web sites. I quickly installed it and over the years used it everywhere in this site.<\/p>\r\n<p>When I upgraded to Joomla! 2.5, I encountered problems with Code Citation but eventually worked through them and got the site up and running. The developer’s stopped work on the project and it isn’t compatible with anything newer than Joomla! 1.6; I wrote about that experience here #######. Last week I noticed that my BlackBerry Development Fundamentals web site (www.bbdevfundamentals.com) was running on a discontinued version of Joomla! and I needed to upgrade it. As I upgraded it, I noticed that I had some source code on the site, so I had to install Code Citation on this upgraded site.<\/p>\r\n<p>Even though I was able to get it working on this site, something was different about the BlackBerry Development Fundamentals site, and the plug-in wouldn’t work there. Every time I got close to a page that used Code Citation, the server would deliver a blank page.&nbsp; I’d pestered the developer of the plug-in so much when I was trying to get Code Citation working on this site, that I didn’t feel right bugging him again. Besides, I really wanted to figure out the GeSHi plug-in anyway, so I set about finally buckling down and figuring it out.<\/p>\r\n<p>First, I found this site: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bitsensei.com\/web\/joomla\/9-using-geshi-in-joomla\/\">http:\/\/www.bitsensei.com\/web\/joomla\/9-using-geshi-in-joomla\/<\/a> which explained how the default Joomla! implementation of GeSHi didn’t include all of the supported language plug-ins (Joomla! only includes a few of the many included with the default GeSHi installation) and how to update the site to include all languages. Additionally, it mentioned how to invoke the plug-in within your web site, but not how to actually implement that on your site’s pages. Ugh! So close.<\/p>\r\n<p>Next, I found the following site:&nbsp; <a href=\"http:\/\/dotcomxl.com\/index.php\/tutorials\/web-design\/115-joomla-syntax-highlighter\">http:\/\/dotcomxl.com\/index.php\/tutorials\/web-design\/115-joomla-syntax-highlighter<\/a> which finally had the information I needed to make this work. The article first provided all sorts of information about how to enhance the output of GeSHI then finally at the end of the article I saw this:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 30px;\">Now that the plugin is enabled, if you want to show code in your articles you should switch to HTML view in your WYSIWYG editor and use this format:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">&lt;pre xml:lang=”java”&gt;<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">Inert your Java Code here<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">&lt;\/pre&gt;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>That’s exactly what I’d been searching for – the other sites mentioned the pre tag, but not how you inserted the code into your article. When using Code Citation, the Code Citation processing tags go at the beginning and end of your code – you don’t need to switch to the HTML editor to enable it. GeSHi apparently requires that, but it wasn’t described that way in all of the sites I looked to for help.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, now I finally knew how to enable GeSHi in a Joomla! web site. Simply bracket the code you want highlighted with the pre and \/pre tags, but do it within the HTML editor as shown in the following figure:<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"margin: 10px; border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2013\/geshi-example.png\" alt=\"GeSHi Example\" height=\"308\" width=\"640\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Of course, going back to the GeSHi web site, I see now that the documentation describe the pre tags but doesn’t mention that you have to insert them from the HTML editor. Another perfect example of how many developers write documentation from the standpoint that you already know how to do something instead of writing it from the standpoint of someone who DOESN’T know how to do something.<\/p>\r\n<p>It…works – the BlackBerry Development Fundamentals site’s code samples render like they should, but I like Code Citation much better. I wish the developer of the plug-in would continue to work on it and update it for Joomla! 2.5 or even 3.0. It’s a much simpler solution and doesn’t require you to go into the HTML editor to format some source code. Right now this site is still working, so I won’t have to revisit this topic until a Joomla! upgrade breaks Code Citation here or until the Code Citation developer releases an update. I hope the latter happens first.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"8","created":"2013-02-21 02:13:43","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2013-02-21 02:23:58","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2013-02-21 02:13:43","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":null,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":null,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":null,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"3","ordering":"5","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"12880","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

Having worked for a device manufacturer then a carrier, I guess I’m a bit spoiled when it comes to connectivity. Over the years I’ve had several tablets, some with cellular connections and some with only Wi-Fi connections.<\/p>\r\n<p>I have to admit that I find that the Wi-Fi only devices never seem to have connectivity when I need it the most. At home (of course), at most airports and at many national chains (hotels, restaurants, stores), there’s usually access, but like I said – often when I really need it it’s just not available.<\/p>\r\n<p>I attended the AT&amp;T Dev Summit in January at a hotel in Las Vegas. Being a networking company (although they really don’t want to be, they want to be so much more) I expected them to provide Wi-Fi access at the event, and they did, but in the movie theater area where most of the ‘sessions’ were held, I could get no coverage. I had some research to do between sessions and a desire to catch-up on some emails, but simply couldn’t get coverage.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now, I was in several movie theaters, away from the conference ‘center’ but none the less, they’d provided coverage, they should have made sure it was available everywhere. If not, why even bother setting it up and promoting it if it’s not most everywhere the conference is being held.<\/p>\r\n<p>My employer provided me with a Wi-Fi only iPad 3 (I refuse to call it the ‘New iPad’) and I was able to order a Mi-Fi hotspot, but I really don’t like carrying (and maintaining charge in) two devices simply to have ubiquitous network coverage. I use the device when I’m at home and at the office, but when I’m out and about I rarely have the Mi-Fi hotspot with me.<\/p>\r\n<p>I recently upgraded my Nexus 7 to a cellular version (AT&amp;T) and I’m going to give the old one to my kids.

This makes for a much better experience for me.<\/p>\r\n<p>The big issue for me is that I’m a BlackBerry user and I don’t have a cellular version of the BlackBerry Playbook.

You can see a sample screen shot of the Rhodes application in Figure 1.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2013\/domino-405-error-1.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>Next I did the same thing using Sencha Touch (www.sencha.com); you can see the application in Figure 2.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2013\/domino-405-error-2.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2<\/p>\r\n<p>As you can see, I finally got around to populating the application with more interesting content.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, as I worked through the Rhodes application, I discovered that by default, the Domino server was blocking HTTP PUT and DELETE requests, so I had to put the following line in the server’s notes.ini file:<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">HTTPEnableMethods=PUT,DELETE<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>Once I did that, the Domino server stopped blocking my requests and everything worked out great.<\/p>\r\n<p>Yesterday, I was working on the Sencha Touch application and read and create worked great, but as soon as I started editing records in the database I started getting the following error on the server:<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">04\/10\/2013 07:47:48 AM HTTP Web Server: The HTTP method is not allowed for the specified URL [\/view\/compete.nsf\/(rest2)?openagent\/2035EE2523E794D785257B4900086A2C&amp;_dc=1365594468245] Anonymous<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>I looked in the Domino log and saw that the problematic URL was:<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">PUT \/view\/compete.nsf\/(rest2)?openagent\/2035EE2523E794D785257B4900086A2C&amp;_dc=1365592049449 HTTP\/1.1<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>You can see the complete Domino log entry in Figure 3.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2013\/domino-405-error-3.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 3<\/p>\r\n<p>I’ve searched and searched and can’t seem to find the solution to this problem.<\/p>\r\n<p>Nothing’s changed on the server and there’s only a few references I can find about that HTTPEnableMethods ini parameter. Most of the stuff I can find on the 405 error all relates to configuring a Domino server to use WebDAV (which I’m not using in this case [am I?]). This was working just fine for my Rhodes application but now fails for the Sencha Touch application and they’re both essentially using the same RESTful service.<\/p>\r\n<p>Can anyone help me understand more about this problem and hopefully (although hope is not a strategy) fix it?<\/p>\r\n<p>In a side note, I wanted to take a look at the server’s notes.ini file and remember that I’d written a utility (back in 1996) called Configuration Manager for Lotus Notes that allowed me to work with a sorted version of the notes.ini . So funny that a utility I wrote 19 years ago is still useful. What fun!<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2013\/domino-405-error-4.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 4<\/p>\r\n<p>I wonder if I should do an update (the DRCC ini reference link isn’t working anymore). You can see the application in Figure 4. I just looked and Wolcott Systems Group has pulled the link to this utility from their web site. No surprise, but sad.<\/p>\r\n<p>Update Apr 11, 2013<\/p>\r\n<p>I'm getting more convinced that I'm not having a Domino server config problem but instead I'm having an authentication problem. Notice in figure 3 that it lists the authenticated user as '-'. I've been poking around in the ACL and have tried setting Anonymous to 'No Access' in order to force a login and even setting Anonymous to Manager - still doesn't allow me to do a PUT to the server. <\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"3","created":"2013-04-10 12:53:57","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2013-04-11 19:59:41","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2013-04-10 12:53:57","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":null,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":null,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":null,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"2","ordering":"3","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"13414","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

{"id":"358","asset_id":"409","title":"The Solution to My Domino Server Configuration Problem","alias":"domino-405-error-solution","introtext":"<p>Thanks to all of you who helped out last week as I struggled to get my IBM Lotus Domino server to accept HTTP PUT and DELETE requests. I posted two articles about my issues, you can access them here:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=355:domino-server-405-error&amp;catid=3:category-domino&amp;Itemid=137\">Domino Server 405 Error<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=356:update-on-my-domino-server-problems&amp;catid=3:category-domino&amp;Itemid=137\">Update on My Domino Server Problems<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>Essentially, I was building a sample Sencha Touch application for an article series I’m writing for The View (www.eview.com) and the Sencha Touch proxy by default uses different HTTP request types for each of the CRUD operations. The Domino server was refusing PUT and DELETE even though there were settings in the Domino Directory which enabled the server to accept them as shown in the following figure:<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2013\/domino%20problem%202.png\" height=\"577\" width=\"640\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>The answer came from Stephan Wissel who said:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 30px;\">... the classic Domino agents to GET\/POST not Put. After you allow it you need to have an endpoint that actually handles PUT. A servlet does that. XPages might since it is a servlet (haven't tested it). Classic agents don't. Probably it is easier to reconfigure your app to use POST?<\/p>\r\n<p>and Nathan Freeman who said:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 30px;\">It spells it out right there in the popup on the label for \"Methods.\" You have to write your own Java servlet to handle PUT and DELETE. The native HTTP server simply doesn't process them at all. The checkbox is there just so the web server will accept those methods on the assumption that it's passing the request to a CGI or Java program that can handle them.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 30px;\">You'll have to write a servlet to do what you're trying to do.<\/p>\r\n<p>So when I enabled the settings shown in Figure 1, all it seemed to do was allow the requests to pass through and I was responsible for implementing a servlet to deal with those requests. Yeah, I’m not doing that.<\/p>\r\n<p>So,&nbsp; I turned to the Sencha Touch Proxy configuration to see if I could change the way it worked to get around this limitation in the Domino server. When I started the process, I had a very simple proxy configuration as shown in the following code segment:<\/p>\r\n<p>{codecitation class=\"brush:javascript\"}proxy : {<br \/>&nbsp; type : 'rest',<br \/>&nbsp; id : 'ci-proxy',<br \/>&nbsp; url : 'http:\/\/server1\/compete.nsf\/(rest2)?openagent',<br \/>&nbsp; enablePagingParams : false,<br \/>&nbsp; reader : {<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; type : 'json',<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rootProperty : 'ci_data'<br \/>&nbsp; }<br \/>}{\/codecitation}<\/p>\r\n<p>Looking through the docs, I found that I could add an actionMethods property to my proxy as shown below:<\/p>\r\n<p>{codecitation class=\"brush:javascript\"}actionMethods : {<br \/>&nbsp; create : \"POST\",<br \/>&nbsp; read : \"GET\",<br \/>&nbsp; update : \"POST\",<br \/>&nbsp; destroy : \"POST\"<br \/>}{\/codecitation}<\/p>\r\n<p>What this does is configure which HTTP methods are used for each proxy action type. OK, that seemed cool although it didn’t get me all the way there. See, when you change the actionMethods property, you lose the ability to easily detect the CRUD operation on the server side. This doesn’t change the URL passed to the Domino server, it only changes the HTTP method used to get to the server.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, what I had to do next was use the proxy’s api property to specify the URL format to use for each request as shown below:<\/p>\r\n<p>{codecitation class=\"brush:javascript\"}api : {<br \/>&nbsp; create : 'http:\/\/server1\/compete.nsf\/(rest2)?openagent&amp;cmd=create',<br \/>&nbsp; read : 'http:\/\/server1\/compete.nsf\/(rest2)?openagent&amp;cmd=read',<br \/>&nbsp; update : 'http:\/\/server1\/compete.nsf\/(rest2)?openagent&amp;cmd=update&amp;',<br \/>&nbsp; destroy : 'http:\/\/server1\/compete.nsf\/(rest2)?openagent&amp;cmd=delete&amp;'<br \/>}{\/codecitation}<\/p>\r\n<p>With this in place, I had now configured the proxy to send a differently formatted URL with each request type.&nbsp; That was exactly what I needed; now I simply had to parse the URL on the server to be able to tell what the Sencha Touch proxy was asking me to do.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"info\">Note: at about the same time I found these settings in the Sencha Touch documentation I received a comment on the site from Jack Ratcliff with a pointer to these settings. Thanks Jack.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, at the end of all of this, here’s what the Sencha Touch proxy configuration looked like:<\/p>\r\n<p>{codecitation class=\"brush:javascript\"}proxy : {<br \/>&nbsp; type : 'rest',<br \/>&nbsp; id : 'ci-proxy',<br \/>&nbsp; url : 'http:\/\/server1\/compete.nsf\/(rest2)?openagent',<br \/>&nbsp; enablePagingParams : false,<br \/>&nbsp; actionMethods : {<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; create : \"POST\",<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; read : \"GET\",<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; update : \"POST\",<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; destroy : \"POST\"<br \/>&nbsp; },<br \/>&nbsp; api : {<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; create : 'http:\/\/server1\/compete.nsf\/(rest2)?openagent&amp;cmd=create',<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; read : 'http:\/\/server1\/compete.nsf\/(rest2)?openagent&amp;cmd=read',<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; update : 'http:\/\/server1\/compete.nsf\/(rest2)?openagent&amp;cmd=update&amp;',<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; destroy : 'http:\/\/server1\/compete.nsf\/(rest2)?openagent&amp;cmd=delete&amp;'<br \/>&nbsp; },<br \/>&nbsp; reader : {<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; type : 'json',<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rootProperty : 'ci_data'<br \/>&nbsp; }<br \/>}{\/codecitation}<\/p>\r\n<p>Worked like a champ! Thanks everyone.<\/p>\r\n<p>I’ll be finishing up the article this weekend and hopefully you’ll see the results in The View in a few weeks.<\/p>\r\n<p>You may be wondering why only the update and destroy commands have the trailing ampersand - you'll have to read the article to see why (sorry).<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"3","created":"2013-04-19 00:51:01","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2013-04-19 12:02:03","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2013-04-19 00:51:01","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":null,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":null,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":null,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"9","ordering":"1","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"35578","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"359","asset_id":"410","title":"What Were They Thinking #13 – VZ Navigator","alias":"wwtt-13","introtext":"<p>While I worked at AT&amp;T, I became a big fan of the TeleNav Navigator application which later became AT&amp;T Navigator. The interface was intuitive and it worked pretty well. When I joined SAP, they gave me a Verizon BlackBerry 9900 and I lost access to the navigation solution I was accustomed to using. On Verizon, they have their own navigation solution called VZ Navigator; here’s what it looks like:<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"images\/stories\/2013\/verizon-navigation-app-1.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>I was using it recently to navigate somewhere and noticed something about the UI that really struck me as stupid, so of course I had to write about it here.<\/p>\r\n<p>When you press the volume buttons on the side of the device to increase or decrease volume, instead of actually increasing or decreasing the navigation volume (which is what ANY smartphone user will expect), the application instead opens up the dialog shown in Figure 2.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"images\/stories\/2013\/verizon-navigation-app-2.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2<\/p>\r\n<p>This is simply the wrong way to implement this interface, and, to make matters worse, you can’t use the volume controls (those buttons on the side of a BlackBerry device) to move the selection on this dialog. I thought perhaps they simply made a mistake by implementing this dialog, but they compounded their error by forcing me to physically touch an item to make a selection rather than to just allow me to use the volume buttons to move the selection down and up on the screen.<\/p>\r\n<p>Think about the use case – I’m driving my car and using this application to help me get to my destination. There’s&nbsp; background noise in the vehicle, so I’m trying to increase the volume so I can hear better – and the application forces me to take my eyes off the road and make a selection on the screen rather than to simply use the buttons that BlackBerry put on the device to allow a user to adjust output volume. What this ‘feature’ does is make the application more difficult to operate and deliberately creates a safety issue for the user (and the occupants of the vehicles around the application user).<\/p>\r\n<p>All the developer had to do was register a listener for the two volume buttons and act accordingly. The developer did register the listener, but instead of implementing expected behavior, they instead broke the application by implementing an unexpected and difficult to operate dialog.

All of the different mobile OS are adding APIs for Twitter, Facebook and so on, why not add a feedback API that allows an app to send customer comments\/feedback to the developer?

{"id":"364","asset_id":"417","title":"Leaving The View","alias":"leaving-the-view","introtext":"<p>Back in 2010, The View (www.eview.com) magazine approached me and asked me if I was interested in becoming a technical advisor to the publication. Being a long-time IBM Lotus Domino developer (a really, really long time) and a speaker at several View Domino Developer conferences, I of course said yes. We spent some time discussing what they needed from me and we decided that a series of articles on mobile development for Domino would be a great fit for my area of expertise. I was onboard.<\/p>\r\n<p>I spent some time thinking about some articles I wanted to write and I solicited some articles from mobile developers I knew. Before long its three years later and I’ve published 20 articles for the magazine (the official 20th one was published last week) and advised on some articles from other authors. It was a great relationship and a lot of fun. At times, I’d have multiple articles in a single edition of the print version of the publication. I even got an article into their best of 2011 Anthology which was distributed at Lotusphere 2012.<\/p>\r\n<p>Over time though, I moved further and further away from the IBM Lotus Domino space. My last real work with Domino ended in 2006 after I’d left Wolcott Systems Group (where I created the award winning Automated Deployment Toolkit for Lotus Notes) and wrapped up a few independent consulting engagements. After that I went to work for RIM (now called BlackBerry) and tinkered a bit with Domino and BlackBerry.&nbsp; At that point any official connection to Domino development ended and it was just a hobby.<\/p>\r\n<p>When I worked at AT&amp;T, they were kind enough to let me dabble in Domino development and speak at some Domino development conferences (the View conferences of course, plus several MWLUG conferences). Now that I’m at SAP, there’s really no way for me to continue to work with Domino. I can’t justify it in my new role as a product manager for the SAP Mobile Platform (SMP) and I’m simply too busy with my day job working on the platform along with my side job of writing Apache Cordova\/Adobe PhoneGap books.<\/p>\r\n<p>A few months back I had a conversation with my new editor at The View and discussed a few article ideas I had. As we talked about it, I really didn’t have anything new and interesting to write about. They were looking for more stuff on Xpages and I didn’t have the skills (or the time to get them). At the end of the conversation we decided that the final article in the Sencha Touch series would be my last for the publication.<\/p>\r\n<p>I’d always wanted to see the article series published into a book. Take my articles and add some of the other mobile development articles that were published and make an ‘everything you ever wanted to know about mobile development for Domino’ book, but I doubt that will ever happen. If it does, it’ll make my day (and be my 5th book, my 4th on mobile development)!<\/p>\r\n<p>I’m beginning discussions with the editors of some of the View’s sister publications on SAP technologies; but who knows where I’ll end up next.&nbsp; I do love to write. I’ll have a new book coming out before the end of the year and hopefully another one early next year.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, it’s been a fun run and I’ve really enjoyed sharing my Domino mobile development experiences with all of you.&nbsp; Stay in touch!<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"3","created":"2013-06-20 01:44:03","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2013-06-20 01:44:03","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":null,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":null,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":null,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"1","ordering":"0","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"9610","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

I will have no access to email or voicemail and will be back in the office on Tuesday July 2.<\/p>\r\n<p>Here are some fun facts about Canada that you may not already know:<\/p>\r\n<p>1. The Stanley Cup has its own bodyguard, but that doesn’t mean Canadian hockey champions haven’t put all kinds of different foods and drinks in it (everything from chocolate milk to popcorn and cereal!)<\/p>\r\n<p>2. British Columbian pioneers made use of the oolichan, also called candlefish, at nighttime. The small fish is so fatty that it can be dried, strung on a wick and burned like a candle!<\/p>\r\n<p>3. Canada’s name comes from a misunderstanding between Jacques Cartier and some Iroquois youth who were pointing out a village (for which they used the word “Kanata”). They were actually trying to identify the small area which is present day Quebec City, but Cartier used the similar-sounding word “Canada” to refer to the whole area. Oops!<\/p>\r\n<p>4. The Narcisse Snake Dens in Manitoba have more snakes in a concentrated area than anywhere else in the world. Tens of thousands of red-sided garter snakes gather there every year. On the other hand, there are no snakes on the island of Newfoundland.<\/p>\r\n<p>5. Canada officially got its own national flag on February 15, 1965 — almost 100 years after it became a country (in 1867).<\/p>\r\n<p>6. Canada’s official languages may be French and English, but our geese have their own language: scientists believe that Canada geese have as many as 13 different calls for everything from greetings and warnings to happiness.<\/p>\r\n<p>7. If you visit Dawson City, Yukon, you can join the “Sourtoe Cocktail Club” — all you have to do is finish a drink (of anything!) with a real human toe in the bottom. The club’s motto says, “You can drink it fast, you can drink it slow — but the lips have gotta touch the toe.”<\/p>\r\n<p>8. In 1962, Pincher Creek, Alberta experienced the fastest, biggest temperature change ever recorded in Canada as a result of a Chinook (a warm, dry wind that comes off the Rocky Mountains). The temperature rose from -19C to 22C in just one hour!<\/p>\r\n<p>9. Between 1984 and 2008, it was illegal to sell pop (this is ‘soda’ for Americans) in cans in PEI. All carbonated drinks had to be purchased in refillable glass bottles. PEI was the only place in North America to have a “can ban.”<\/p>\r\n<p>10.

I used to travel a lot and bring a bunch of cables and so on with me in a little pouch. Over time, the pouch has gotten bigger and bigger and now, with all of the devices I carry with me, it looks like this:<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000; margin: 5px;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2013\/chargecard1.png\" alt=\"My Current Cable Pouch\" title=\"My Current Cable Pouch\" height=\"403\" width=\"640\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Anyways, the ChargeCard is a single, credit card-sized piece of rubber\/plastic that includes two USB connectors. There’s a micro USB connector for your standard BlackBerry, Android device and so on plus there’s a USB Type A connector for plugging into your laptop or PC USB receptacle. The card is about the thickness of two credit cards and looks like this:<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"margin: 5px; border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2013\/chargecard2.png\" alt=\"ChargeCard\" title=\"ChargeCard\" height=\"508\" width=\"640\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The exposed micro USB connector plugs into most any modern smartphone except for any iOS product. The PC USB connector is made of a flexible rubber-like material which allows you to bend it out of the card and insert it in the appropriate USB receptacle on your PC.<\/p>\r\n<p>It is pretty cool and takes up a whole lot less room than my assortment of cables. It is super small, so I can easily fit it in my bag and take it anywhere with me.<\/p>\r\n<p>It’s a little pricy at $25, but well worth it when you consider how small and useful it is.<\/p>\r\n<p>For those devices that don’t use a standard micro USB connector (that would pretty much only be iOS devices, too bad) the ChardgeCard folks also make a ChargeCard for those devices as well. It’s not their fault, but if you carry both an Android and iOS device, you’ll need to carry two ChargeCards with you in order to be able to charge both.

SAP recently released a product SAP Mobile Documents and as its standards-based I wanted to learn more about the underlying technology so I ordered a copy of CMIS and Apache Chemistry in Action. When the package arrived, there were two boxes. I was expecting one box, so the second one surprised me.<\/p>\r\n<p>I opened both and one was my copy of CMIS and Apache Chemistry in Action and the other contained Guitar for Dummies. I don’t play guitar, so that particular book surprised me a bit. I hadn’t ordered the book and I wasn’t expecting a gift from anyone. The packing slip didn’t have much on it except for an order number, so I looked up the order number and couldn’t find it. I initiated a chat with Amazon customer service and apparently the order belonged to someone else. I’m not quite sure why they put it in a package and addressed it to me, but there it was.<\/p>\r\n<p>Even though I told Amazon that I hadn’t ordered it, they took a while and finally determined that it wasn’t mine and I’d not ordered it. No surprise to me, but apparently they had to double verify that the package they sent to me wasn’t for me.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, I expected that they’d email me a shipping label and thank me for sending it back to them.<\/p>\r\n<p>Nope, that’s not what happened<\/p>\r\n<p>They told me I could keep it. Apparently there’s no way for Amazon to generate a shipping label and send it to a customer if the order the shipping label is for is not on the customer’s account.<\/p>\r\n<p>No, seriously – that’s what they told me.<\/p>\r\n<p>They have one of the most sophisticated and automated online and warehouse management systems in the world and they can’t fix it when one of their folks ships me something I didn’t order. That’s quite a systems problem they have – rather than simply enable customer service reps to order ad-hoc shipping labels, they let me keep an item they sold for $20 or so.<\/p>\r\n<p>What’s funny is that this isn’t the only time this happened to me. Last week I ordered some CDs from my wish list (some Dream Theater, Tony Iommi and Ian Gillan) and they shipped it to me, it never arrived and they shipped it to me again. Apparently the exact same thing happened with my order – they picked it, but shipped it to someone else. What’s funny about this is that about a week later I got an email from Amazon Customer Service telling me that they were unable to deliver a package to me. Even though they send me packages all the time and the address they have on file for me is spot on, they suddenly couldn’t find me.<\/p>\r\n<p>It all worked out, my son’s learning guitar, so I gave the book to him.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2013-08-04 21:19:07","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2013-08-05 13:00:23","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"1","ordering":"72","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"7773","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

{"id":"370","asset_id":"424","title":"Using Joomla K2","alias":"using-joomla-k2","introtext":"<p>I’ve started work on the web site for my upcoming book, Apache Cordova Programming.<\/p>\r\n<p>For my <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bbdevfundamentals.com\">BlackBerry Development Fundamentals<\/a>, I created the site using Joomla. For <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.phonegapessentials.com\">PhoneGap Essentials<\/a>, I wanted to learn Drupal, so I used it to build the book’s web site. For my <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.newsoccerref.com\/\">What Now? The Essential Guide for New Soccer Referees<\/a>, I used the Concrete 5 CMS. Since I've used a different CMS for each book's web site, it would be cool to continue the tradition, but no other CMS has caught my eye. I wanted to try to use Xoops for something, but that one seems to have withered on the vine.<\/p>\r\n<p>Drupal is very powerful, but a little hard to work with. You have great power in what you can do with a site, but I found it to be pretty slow and cumbersome. Unfortunately, for the type of site I wanted to build for PhoneGap Essentials, Drupal was a great choice as the very powerful Content Creation Kit (CCK) was moved into the core of Drupal beginning with Drupal 7. The CCK allowed me to easily define custom fields for my different content types and render and sort by those fields in views. It was pretty cool and I was able to quickly do what I wanted with the site – customizing the Chapters (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.phonegapessentials.com\/chapters.html\">http:\/\/www.phonegapessentials.com\/chapters.html<\/a>) and Errata (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.phonegapessentials.com\/errata.html\">http:\/\/www.phonegapessentials.com\/errata.html<\/a>) views on the site.<\/p>\r\n<p>I’m a super big fan of Joomla, and although Drupal would give me the flexibility I needed to make the site I needed, I would really prefer to do it with Joomla. So, I registered a domain, setup a Joomla site (using the latest and greatest version of course) and started looking for a way to get the CCK capabilities I wanted with a Joomla-based web site.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you search through the Joomla Extension Directory and look at CCK extensions, the JoomlaWorks K2 extension is listed as one of the most popular. I looked around on their web site (<a href=\"http:\/\/getk2.org\">http:\/\/getk2.org<\/a>) and it looked like it had everything I needed. I installed it and figured out how to use it fairly quickly although there is absolutely no documentation available for the extension. There are video tutorials, but no documentation at all that I can find. After playing around with it for a while, I was frustrated to find that it really doesn’t provide the capabilities I need. It works (sort of) and it has a pretty cool set of features, but falls down in the critical places where I need it the most.<\/p>\r\n<p>I was able to add extra fields like Chapter and Page, and built some field groups to group them together.&nbsp; My Chapter content needed the Chapter field, but the Errata article type needed both Chapter and Page. Unfortunately, for some bizarre reason, you can’t have a field in two field groups. Makes no sense to me, but that is the way it works. So, I had to add a Chapter field for the Chapter article type and another Chapter field for the Errata article type. Ugh.<\/p>\r\n<p>There’s no numeric field type. I can add a bunch of extra fields, but not numeric fields. If you look at the previous paragraph, doesn’t Chapter and Page Number fields imply they’re numeric? Nope, had to create them as text, not numeric fields. Next to useless.<\/p>\r\n<p>K2 doesn’t seem to support any custom views. Now that I have all of my chapter content entered with my shiny new Chapter field added, I want to create a view that allows me to render articles sorted by chapter number. Nope, can’t do it. Not only can’t you show a custom field in a view, you can’t sort on it either. What’s the sense of allowing me to add additional fields to an article if I can’t use them for anything.&nbsp; And, since I have to use text fields instead of numeric fields, even if I could use them in views, they would still sort as 1, 10, 2, 3 and so on since that’s the way sorting by textual numbers works.<\/p>\r\n<p>What’s the point?<\/p>\r\n<p>It seems like they expect you to extend Joomla’s article system in order to create custom views, but that seems like more trouble than it’s worth. I’ve printed out a tutorial on the topic and we’ll see over the next couple of weeks if I can figure it out.<\/p>\r\n<p>I tried using the Article Manager to force the order of the Chapter articles, but could not make it work any way I tried. The default Joomla article manager allows me to do it, but not K2.<\/p>\r\n<p>Over the last few months, I’ve posted some questions to the K2 forums. When I’m up there looking around, there’s nobody else but me up there, so it really feels like an unpopular or near death extension.<\/p>\r\n<p>I’ve posted question on the forums asking how I can create custom views. I’ve asked where the documentation is.&nbsp; I’ve asked why there’s no numeric field type. No response. I did get one response, but the responder used Google Translate to translate my question and the response I got back (translated back into English) was incomprehensible.<\/p>\r\n<p>It sure feels like K2 is near death. It has great aspirations, but simply doesn’t deliver. Too bad, it looked like a good option for me.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"8","created":"2013-08-25 21:56:00","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2013-08-25 22:02:08","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2013-08-25 21:56:00","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/2013\\\/k2.png\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/2013\\\/k2.png\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"4","ordering":"4","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"10923","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

The Cordova team recently released version 3 of the popular open source mobile development framework and this should be the first book on the topic.<\/p>\r\n<p>The book is essentially a rewrite of the first half of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.phonegapessentials.com\"><em>PhoneGap Essentials<\/em><\/a>. The Cordova tooling changed dramatically after <em>PhoneGap Essentials<\/em> was published, so the first half of that older book was pretty out of date. The first chapter is essentially the same, while the rest of the book focuses primarily on the tooling, but the last 100 pages cover the Cordova APIs, creating plugins and the end to end development process. It’s complete coverage of the topic, but simply doesn’t go into the APIs in as much detail as <em>PhoneGap Essentials<\/em> did.<\/p>\r\n<p>In <em>PhoneGap Essentials<\/em> I wrote in detail about all of the supported mobile device platforms, but in this book, I focused only on Android, BlackBerry 10, iOS and Windows Phone 8. Additionally, <em>PhoneGap Essentials<\/em> didn’t contain anything about PhoneGap or Cordova plugins, so in this edition I added a chapter where I create two plugins, one which is JavaScript only (for educational purposes) and another which is a native plugin for Android and iOS.<\/p>\r\n<p>I’m pretty excited about the book; it’s about 300 pages and should be out in electronic version pretty soon and available as a printed book before Christmas. I will post an update on the site as soon as it’s available from my publisher at www.informit.com and amazon.com. Right now the book's web site is not operational, but I will fix that by the end of the week.<\/p>\r\n<p>I really want to do an update on the second half of <em>PhoneGap Essentials<\/em>, so I’m having a discussion with my publisher about that as well.

I understand having a laptop, smartphone and tablet. I expect the smartphone to be used while in motion, the tablet used when more time is available or when more ‘stuff’ needs to be done and laptop when heavy typing, creative work or just high quantity of mail filing (iOS is horrible for enterprise mail use simply for that reason alone) is needed.<\/p>\r\n<p>So the worker starts the day on his or her Android smartphone, switches later to a laptop, then tablet, then a desktop? Really? Desktop AND laptop? Next they fire up a Windows 8 device then wrap up their day with the Android smartphone again?<\/p>\r\n<p>That’s not how it works is it? It’s highly unlikely that the worker is going to have access to a desktop and a laptop – I expect that in today’s economy that the user is expected to connect their laptop when in the office to do work, not use a desktop that’s sitting there waiting for him to use it.<\/p>\r\n<p>From a tablet standpoint, is the employee really going to have both an iOS tablet and a touch-screen Windows 8 device? I think not. Very few organizations are fiscally irresponsible enough to do that.<\/p>\r\n<p>I understand what they’re trying to do, highlight all of the different targets they support, but highlighting all of them as an example of a day in the life of a mobile worker makes no sense.

Essentially, I was trying to install the application on the device via a USB cable, but my Windows system wasn&rsquo;t recognizing the device. The device saw that it was connected to the Windows system and prompted me to enable USB debugging, but Windows was &lsquo;seeing&rsquo; the device, but couldn&rsquo;t really talk to it.<\/p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;d encountered this problem while working on Apache Cordova 3 Programming and figured it out, but for the life of me I couldn&rsquo;t remember how I&rsquo;d done it. I of course grabbed the manuscript and looked to see if I&rsquo;d documented the solution to the problem and of course I hadn&rsquo;t. So, I thought I&rsquo;d write about it here then I&rsquo;ll put a link in the book that points to this article.<\/p>\r\n<p>OK, so when I plugged the device in, Windows twirled and whirled for a while trying to install the appropriate device driver. After much work, it finally decided that it couldn&rsquo;t do so and displayed an error message. When I looked at the Windows Device Manager, I noticed what is shown in the following figure, that it recognized the device, but simply didn&rsquo;t know what to do with it. Notice under &lsquo;Other devices&rsquo; that the Nexus 7 is listed.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2013\/nexus-7-setup_1.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure <span>1<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>So, I knew that Google provides special USB device driver as part of their SDK, so I fired up the SDK tools and made sure to select the Google USB Driver as shown in the following figure.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2013\/nexus-7-setup_2.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure <span>2<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>With that in place, I was ready to fix this problem. In Windows Device Manager, back in Figure 1, I right-clicked on the Nexus 7 entry and from the menu that appeared I selected Update Driver Software. In the dialog that appears, I selected Browse my computer for driver software as shown in the Figure <span>3<\/span>.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2013\/nexus-7-setup_3.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure <span><span>3<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>Next I was prompted to identify where Windows should search for the driver. I could have let it search the whole drive, but I knew that the driver I wanted was likely in the folder where I&rsquo;d installed the Android development tools (ADT), so I simply pointed it to that folder then clicked next to begin the search.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2013\/nexus-7-setup_4.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure <span>4<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>After a while, it found the driver, installed it then displayed the results screen shown in Figure <span>5<\/span>.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"images\/stories\/2013\/nexus-7-setup_5.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure <span><span>5<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>Closing the dialog and looking again at the Windows Device Manager as shown in Figure <span>6<\/span>, you&rsquo;ll see that the Nexus 7 is now recognized by Windows as an Android Composite ADB Interface device.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2013\/nexus-7-setup_6.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure <span><span>6<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>With this completed, I was able to install the application onto the device using the Android command line tools.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"14","created":"2013-09-27 12:08:24","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2016-04-10 22:33:13","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2013-09-27 12:08:24","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"8","ordering":"37","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"9626","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

The keyboard is awesome and the form factor is perfect – much better than the super-silly iPhone.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, I do miss the keyboard though. One of the things that has always made the BlackBerry perfect for heavy mail and PIM usage is how the keyboard simplifies so many tasks. Filing a message is as easy as hitting the i key and starting to type the first letters of the folder name and you can file the message in no time. When filing subsequent emails, the last folder used for messages from that thread appears as soon as you press the i key. Android and iOS make this as hard as possible by not allowing you to bring up a keyboard while filing a message. Ugh.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, as I’ve been using the Z30, I’ve noticed how they don’t make it easy to delete messages after you’ve read them. There’s no delete key (because there’s no physical keyboard) and they don’t expose the delete button in the default UI shown at the bottom-right of the following figure.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2013\/z30-mail-1.png\" alt=\"Z30 Mail UI Portrait\" title=\"Z30 Mail UI Portrait\" class=\"caption\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>If you want to delete a message, you have to tap that three-button more thingie (whatever that is) and select delete from the menu that appears. Inconveniencing, but I’m OK with it. Although I would argue that delete would be used a lot more than the Search button, so they could switch the position of the two and make a LOT of users happier.<\/p>\r\n<p>As I looked at the screen, it occurred to me that perhaps if I turn the device sideways, the delete button I need so much would appear (since there’s much more room in landscape mode). So, I rotated the device then took the screen shot shown below.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2013\/z30-mail-2.png\" alt=\"Z30 Mail UI Landscape\" title=\"Z30 Mail UI Landscape\" class=\"caption\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Notice that with all of that additional available real estate, all they did was expand the distance between the buttons. What a waste. With all of that extra room, what I expect is that the most used items from the menu will drop down into that lower menu and be available to me in one click instead of two. Nope, they didn’t do that.<\/p>\r\n<p>This is another example of what happens when developers don’t think about how users will actually use their software. It’s easier to keep the same buttons rather than make use of the additional space. Too bad.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"15","created":"2013-10-16 01:55:34","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2013-10-16 02:02:53","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2013-10-16 01:55:34","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"2","ordering":"6","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"10550","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

My favorite session was by Lyza Danger Gardner where she covered PhoneGap Self Defense for Web Devs. It was a fast-paced and very interesting session about the things that a PhoneGap (and Cordova or course) developer must keep in mind while developing web applications for the PhoneGap container. It all made perfect sense as I listened to her speak, but it happened so fast that I know I’m going to have to watch it again to make it sink in. This is an absolute must see for anyone building hybrid applications. You can find the video recording of her session at <a href=\"http:\/\/phonegap.com\/blog\/2013\/10\/18\/phonegap-self-defense\/\">http:\/\/phonegap.com\/blog\/2013\/10\/18\/phonegap-self-defense\/<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>There was another session that is worth noting; not because it was good, but for other reasons I shall try to explain.<\/p>\r\n<p>Apparently the PhoneGap and Cordova development teams are beer drinkers. So, with much fanfare, they started serving beer beginning at lunch (and throughout the remainder of PhoneGap day). I like beer and I even like drinking beer (on special occasions of course) for breakfast and sometimes even lunch. In this case, I was in a room where a whole bunch of young people had started drinking beer at about 12:30.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, I made the mistake of saying something to someone standing next to me after lunch and he manhandled me into a conversation that I wasn’t very interested in but consumed a lot of time. Apparently this particular person had had a few beers and that only exacerbated his outgoing personality. Well, it turns out that he was a presenter and he soon went up on stage and delivered what was, in my opinion, the most inappropriate and unprofessional conference presentation I’ve ever seen (and I even saw John Cleese [of Monty Python fame] say ‘asshole’ during a keynote at an IBM conference).

I had a personal email account back in the very early 90’s, back in the dial-up ISP days, so I’ve seen spam from its infancy.<\/p>\r\n<p>Notice I’m calling it spam and not SPAM or Spam. In an email context, spam is not an acronym, so I’m truly not sure why people capitalize all of the letters in the word. Spam on the other hand is a tasty breakfast meat (although it can be eaten at any time during the day or night) that I used to have all the time while camping as a boy scout.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyways, spammers have been trying all sorts of tricks to get past filters, and it’s always interesting to see how it works inside. This morning I received the following email message.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"images\/stories\/2013\/spam-1-10-28-2013_640.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>My email client recognized the from address, so it let the graphics display (the PayPal logo), but I knew immediately that it couldn’t have been from PayPal mostly because I’m pretty sure they’ll never email me to tell me that my account has been limited. They might email me to tell me that my account has been disabled, and probably tell me why, but what the heck does “your account has been limited” even mean?<\/p>\r\n<p>Looking at the email, you can see that the email content is in a san serif font and the click here link is in a serif font. Clearly the person who crafted this email isn’t very good with HTML. Also, in reading the email, you can see it was written by someone who doesn’t speak English as a primary language.&nbsp; For example, the phrase “The account will continue to be frozen until it is approved And Validate Your Account Information” is a dead giveaway as it’s not really English.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, I always look at the email message source to make sure and when I looked at the source for this message, I found the following:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2013\/spam-2-10-28-2013_640.png\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2<\/p>\r\n<p>The way to tell that this email did not come from PayPal is through the links to resources embedded within the email as well as links to outside entities. For example, as you can see from Figure 2, the logo image comes from a site called jewelleryminx dot com. Hmmm, that doesn’t sound like a paypal server to me.<\/p>\r\n<p>Notice too the link to ‘validate my account info’ – this one is the tricky part. If you look at this, you should notice immediately that it looks like it is pointing you to PayPal because the link points to paypal.com, right? Wrong. The link URL begins with paypal.com, but in reality, the URL is a very long and complicated subdomain of givarperu dot org. Anyone who thinks they know what they’re doing, including spam filters I think, will see that the URL begins with <a href=\"https:\/\/paypal.com\">https:\/\/paypal.com<\/a> and assume it’s pointing to PayPal when it is actually pointing to a server registered in Lima Peru, see the domain registration below.<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2013\/spam-3-10-28-2013.png\" height=\"1092\" width=\"512\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 3<\/p>\r\n<p>So, these are a few simple things you can do to tell whether an email is spam or not.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2013-10-28 12:42:46","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2013-10-28 12:47:20","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2013-10-28 12:47:20","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"2","ordering":"66","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"7012","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

This causes a lot of problems for developers because it’s not easy to tell what’s happened.<\/p>\r\n<p>Let me give you an example.<\/p>\r\n<p>When I read through the PhoneGap support forums, a common problem that occurs regularly is that people complain that the Cordova deviceready event doesn’t fire. When I first started working with PhoneGap, my first forum post was about that particular issue. Embarrassing it was, but apparently I had a typo in the &lt;script&gt; tag which loaded the phonegap.js file, so the PhoneGap container simply didn’t even fire the deviceready event. A quick change to my JavaScript code to include the correct name for the phonegap.js file (at the time they were labeling each version of the file with a version number like phonegap-1.0.js, and I’d simply added phonegap.js to my app). A simple typo, but caused problems none the less.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, when the Cordova or PhoneGap container encounters a JavaScript error, it simply aborts whatever it is doing and doesn’t tell the user anything. Ugh. I can’t tell you how much time I’ve wasted tracking down bugs caused by this simple error.<\/p>\r\n<p>When I joined the mobile platform product management team at SAP, I mentioned this problem in a room full of developers and my colleague Istvan Nagy quickly provided me with the solution.

I took a look at the site and saw that it’s a pretty cool way to define a simple landing page for yourself. Here’s my profile:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2013\/hi.im 1.im_640.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>Now, when you login, you have a lot of options for what you include in your profile as shown in Figure 2. As I’m using this for my professional persona, there’s only a few things I want to add to my profile. For personal use, the list of social networks for example includes all of the common social network options. If you’re heavily into social media, you can pepper your profile with a ton of stuff.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2013\/hi.im 2_640.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2<\/p>\r\n<p>Some of the options, such as some of the profile design settings are limited until you upgrade your account. For $20 per year you get more control over the page. It might be worth it, but I’m not ready yet – keep reading.<\/p>\r\n<p>After I setup my account, I got a nice email from the person who created this site (I’m assuming) welcoming me to the system:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2013\/hi.im 3_640.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 3<br \/>So I easily added a contact me option to my profile then my linkedin profile. Next I wanted to add my twitter account (@johnwargo) but when I tried to add it, I got the following error:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2013\/hi.im 4_640.png\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>Figure 4<\/p>\r\n<p>I’ve tried time and time again to setup this connection and I consistently get the same error.

Well, I had an email from Jonathan, right? So I thought I’d let him know about the error. I replied to his email – no response. Next I followed them on twitter and let them know that I’ve been encountering errors – no response.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>So, I was going to upgrade my account so I could put images and more stuff on my profile, but as I can’t make it work and I can’t them to respond to my inquiries, I guess I’m going to have to give up.<\/p>\r\n<p>Postscript: I found a help link on the bottom of their home page (those links aren't shown when you login and it takes you automatically to your profile page). I've sent them two emails asking for help with no response. I've also emailed that Jonathan guy who emailed me when I setup my account - no response from my first and second emails.&nbsp; I know it's a free service, but they'd get my $20 if I could actually make this thing work.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2013-11-12 14:07:39","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2013-11-14 20:09:17","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2013-11-12 14:07:39","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"3","ordering":"62","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"9340","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

When it completed, I plugged it back into my Windows 8 desktop and suddenly the device couldn’t be seen by the PC. It would beep and let me know it’d seen the device and was installing the necessary driver, but it would quickly beep again and tell me it couldn’t install the driver.

{"id":"406","asset_id":"461","title":"Airplane Etiquette ","alias":"airplane-etiquette","introtext":"<p>I spent the weekend in Buffalo snowmobiling with some very old friends. As I flew on several Southwest airlines flights I was reminded of a little piece of airplane etiquette that most people don’t think\/know of.<\/p>\r\n<p>Imagine you get on the plane and sit towards the front of the plane, but get on later in the process and the front overhead compartments are full. You move back to an open overhead compartment further and store your stuff then head up to your seat for the ride to wherever you are going.<\/p>\r\n<p>When the plane lands, you need your stuff, right? So you politely push back toward the back of the plane and the location for your stuff. One you’ve retrieved your stuff, do you stay where you are, or are the people you’ve pushed past responsible for letting you make it back to your seat?<\/p>\r\n<p>I say you stay where you are. What do you think?<\/p>\r\n<p>I thought about this on one of my flights to Buffalo and on the way back I encountered it. I was in the third row and someone needed past me to get her stuff from further back in the plane. When I felt her trying to make her way back, I asked her ‘Going back for your stuff?’ and she responded, I can’t remember exactly what she said, indicating that she was going back but somehow expected to go back to the front rows when she was done.<\/p>\r\n<p>Think about it – all sorts of people moved out of the way so she could make her way back. As they let her past, they compressed forward and took up the space she previously filled at the front of the plane. There isn’t the room nor the need to let her back up to her original position.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, because I’m a stinker, I noticed this and waited for her to begin her move back up to the front of the plane. I felt a tap on my shoulder and her request for me to let her by. I (politely of course) told her that I was trying to get out of her way (by leaving the plane) and she persisted by saying that she needed to get her purse.<\/p>\r\n<p>She completely missed the point that everyone in front of her now were in the process of leaving the plane and that if she stayed in her position, she would quickly be able to collect the remainder of her stuff. Why did she immediately assume that all of us should get out of her way so that she could leave the plane sooner than us? Why was she so important that she had to leave earlier?<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, she finally got the point and stayed where she was and was able to collect all of her belongings and get off the plane without treating us like she was more important than us.<\/p>\r\n<p>If it’s me, I politely ask for help getting me back to where my stuff is then WAIT with everyone else to leave the plane from the position where I ended up.

For all of BlackBerry’s focus on quality and design, I’m find BlackBerry 10 to be really, really hard to use on a day to day basis. So many of the things I loved about BlackBerry just aren’t in BlackBerry 10 and I’m finding the UX to be…klunky.<\/p>\r\n<p>I went out of town this weekend to hang out with some friends. I have a BlackBerry Z30 device, and it has a HUGE battery, so I expected to get a whole day’s use out of it, but no go. Around 7 PM, after starting the day with a full charge, the battery was on its last legs.<\/p>\r\n<p>Fortunately for me, the folks at Adobe gave me a free USB battery at PhoneGap Day 2013, so I pulled it out in order to give myself a boost. I only got a few minutes out of the battery, but that’s not what I’m here to talk to you about.<\/p>\r\n<p>As the battery started to lose its charge, the warning shown in the figure below started to appear.

It would display for a while, go away for a few seconds then immediately come back – over and over again. The problem is that it’s really hard to use the device with this message constantly popping up and going away. The touch screen is essentially unusable as long as this behavior continues.<\/p>\r\n<p>I was trying to meet some friends and my battery dying and this stupid continuous warning was really annoying.

I want to teach my son about computer programming and this seemed like an interesting way to do it. The server is called Google Coder and it’s delivered as a Raspbian image for the Pi. Pretty cool; I’m hoping to learn more about it and write a bit about my findings here.<\/p>\r\n<p>As I set it up and started playing with it, I was hit by one of my pet peeves. First you fire up the server then connect to it via your desktop browser (right, it’s not something you use on your Pi, but instead something you host on your Pi and connect to it from your desktop PC). When you connect to the server, you’re prompted to provide a password in order to access the system as shown in the following figure.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2014\/coder-password-error-1.png\" alt=\"Coder Password Prompt\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>Honestly I’m really not sure why I need a secure connection to my Pi (notice the HTTPS in the browser’s address field) and I’m also not sure why I need a password, but I’ll dig into that at some later time.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, so it wants me to use a password so I went ahead and typed on in. After clicking the ‘Save My Password’ button shown in the figure, what I see next is the following:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2014\/coder-password-error-2.png\" alt=\"Coder Password Error\" title=\"Coder Password Error\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2<\/p>\r\n<p>There it is – one of my biggest developer pet peeves. If you know that you’re going to want me to include upper case, lower case and numbers in my password, why not tell me BEFORE I tell you the password I want to use?<\/p>\r\n<p>I see this all the time and it makes absolutely no sense to me. You’re asking me for input and you know exactly how you want that input formatted, why don’t you share that information with me so I can save a little time here? After all, it’s not like you have a hidden camera and you can get some pleasure from watching me type in a password only to later learn it doesn’t meet your requirements.<\/p>\r\n<p>Developers, if you have any input, password or any other requirements you’re obligated to tell me what they are BEFORE I provide you with the input. There’s no other way. You took the time to type in the requirements into the error message shown in the second figure, why not copy and paste the exact same information into the original input form?<\/p>\r\n<p>I know why it was done this way, some designer designed the password form and it had to look cool and clean. The error warning was an afterthought or was implemented by someone AFTER the design of the password form had been completed.

This morning I found one that was even worse than the Google Coder one I showed earlier.<\/p>\r\n<p>I was playing around with the Intel XDK development tools for web applications. After I got it installed, it prompted me to create an account. I filled in all of the fields and went looking for any indicator that the form had password requirements. None found, so I clicked the Submit button only to find out that for some unknown reason, Intel requires a special character in the password as shown at the very bottom, in small print, in the following figure:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2014\/intel-stupid-password.png\" alt=\"Intel XDK Registration Form\" title=\"Intel XDK Registration Form\" class=\"caption\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>So, I dutifully added a special character (I’m not telling you which one) and clicked Submit again only to find out that they had yet another requirement. Apparently you also have to have a number in your password, but Intel made no effort to inform me of any of this.<\/p>\r\n<p>At this point, I’ve failed twice and I still don’t know if my password with a special character AND a number will actually fulfill the requirements. I crossed my fingers and clicked Submit for the third time only to find out that I had actually, unbeknownst to me, complied with the password requirements. Woohoo!<\/p>\r\n<p>Developers, when you have an input form that has specific input requirements – TELL ME WHAT THEY ARE. I shouldn’t have to guess what your password requirements are; you know what they are, so tell me BEFORE I start typing in my password.

{"id":"410","asset_id":"465","title":"First Arduino Project","alias":"first-arduino-project","introtext":"<p>My dad was a tool geek, I&rsquo;m a gadget geek. All my life I&rsquo;ve been drawn toward technology. When I was a kid, I was constantly biking to Radio Shack to pick up one of their assemble-it-yourself electronics kits. I build radios, sound generators and anything I could get my hands on. I wanted to be an Electrical Engineer, but my grades weren&rsquo;t good enough, so I went into Physics and Computers &ndash; go figure.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, my son&rsquo;s a gadget geek as well. He&rsquo;s 10, so all he knows is smartphones and tablets &ndash; every time I get a new device, he goes crazy for it and tries to show me how it works. Doesn&rsquo;t he understand that I&rsquo;m in the smartphone business and will always know more than him for at least a few more years?<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ve been playing around a bit with the Raspberry Pi (I&rsquo;ve posted several articles here about my experiences) and I&rsquo;ve always wanted to play with some programmable microcontrollers. My neighbor got me to take a look at some microcontrollers from Texas Instruments, but I&rsquo;ve not done anything with them yet. I&rsquo;m most interested in the Arduino, but again haven&rsquo;t had time to play much with it...until now.<\/p>\r\n<p>My son and I were discussing possible geek projects to work on and we decided to trick out a&hellip;well, it&rsquo;s a secret, but I&rsquo;ll write about it as soon as I can. We decided we needed a very small package for this project and I knew the Arduino was going to be too big. So I started looking around at smaller versions of the Arduino to use. The first one I found was the Teensy (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pjrc.com\/teensy\/\">https:\/\/www.pjrc.com\/teensy\/<\/a>), its super small, and I think this is the one we&rsquo;ll ultimately use for our &lsquo;project.&rsquo;<br \/>I wanted to breadboard this out first, so I picked up an Arduino Micro (<a href=\"http:\/\/arduino.cc\/en\/Main\/arduinoBoardMicro\">http:\/\/arduino.cc\/en\/Main\/arduinoBoardMicro<\/a>) from Adafruit (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/1086\">https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/1086<\/a>) &ndash; very nice, very small (although bigger than the super small Teensy). This one comes with headers (the Teensy doesn&rsquo;t) and fits nicely into a breadboard as you can see from the following figure.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2014\/arduino-1.png\" alt=\"First Arduino Project\" title=\"First Arduino Project\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>For this particular project, the Arduino needs to know how it&rsquo;s oriented in space, so I picked up a Arduino Accelerometer module from Adafruit (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/163\">https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/163<\/a>). The 3g one seemed good enough, but since I bought that one the Adafruit team came up with a 16g so I picked up one of those as well. I imagine the 16g model will make it into our &lsquo;project.&rsquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>I planned on working on our project this weekend, but of course forgot to pick up a breadboard. My son and I headed off to Radio Shack (oh, the memories from when I was a kid), picked up a breadboard, battery holder and a battery and got to work.<br \/>I first installed the Arduino IDE then connected the board to the computer and tested it worked by running the blink sample application. Next I wired up a single LED and got that working. After that, I wired in 5 LEDs, showing my son how to use the breadboard and make the circuit. With 5 LEDs working, I started playing around with the application code to see if we could come up with some cool blink patterns. I did them the hard way, turning each light on and off as needed individually, so I could show my son how the code worked. He quickly got bored, so when he went off to play with his friends, I refactored the code, added arrays and loops and created some pretty tight code. Tomorrow I&rsquo;m adding a cylon pattern, it will be fun.<\/p>\r\n<p>Next I added the headers to the accelerometer module; I wish it came with headers pre-installed because I quickly mucked up that task. Anyway, with the accelerometer wired in, the project can tell its orientation in space. Tomorrow my son and I will start programming different behavior depending on the project&rsquo;s orientation in space. Like I said, I&rsquo;ll write all about it once I get it all done.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"41","created":"2014-03-16 01:18:34","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2015-08-16 16:41:48","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2014-03-16 01:18:34","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"3","ordering":"29","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"9780","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

I plan on doing some analysis of this, but simply haven’t gotten around to it.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, I had some issues with the CAPTCHA on this site, and my comments plugin provider isn’t responding to any forum posts on the topic so I had to just leave the comments on and use the plugin’s moderation capabilities to weed out the spam.

That book was published more than two years ago and PhoneGap has changed dramatically since then. The code in the book should still work - not much has changed on the API side of things. The content covered in the first half of the book however is no longer valid. <br \/> <br \/> I rewrote the first half of PhoneGap Essentials last year and released it as Apache Cordova 3 Programming in December. That book takes the first 150 pages dedicated to PhoneGap development and PhoneGap tools and updates it for Cordova 3 plus expands it out to about 250 pages.

As PhoneGap is a distribution of Cordova, you’d think that a book on Cordova would address both markets.

The chapter introduces you to the concept of Apache Cordova, what it does, how it works and what it’s used for.&nbsp; The book is targeted to mobile developers who have at least a little exposure to Apache Cordova, so this chapter is for those people who skipped the requirements and bought the book anyway – I had to give them a quick intro so they’d be able to understand the remainder of the book. It’s a good chapter and should give you a good teaser of what kind of stuff you’ll find in the rest of the book. If you like it, please buy the book. If you’re just getting started with Apache Cordova or Adobe PhoneGap development, you may want to take a look at the companion book: Apache Cordova 3 Programming (www.corodvaprogramming.com).<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"14","created":"2014-07-31 22:27:01","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2014-07-31 22:32:36","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2014-07-31 22:27:01","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/2014\\\/introduction-to-apache-cordova-120.png\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/2014\\\/introduction-to-apache-cordova-640.png\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"3","ordering":"23","metakey":"Apache Cordova Introduction","metadesc":"Introduction to Apache Cordova","access":"1","hits":"9402","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"John M.

{"id":"416","asset_id":"471","title":"CEF & Monty Python","alias":"cef-monty-python","introtext":"<p>Note: The original title for this post was supposed to be ‘How is the Chromium Embedded Framework Documentation like a Sketch from Monty Python’s Meaning of Life?’ but the title was just too long.<\/p>\r\n<p>I was getting some exercise yesterday and came up with an idea for an app I wanted to write. The app needed to work for Windows as well as Macintosh, so I started thinking about how I’d do it. I’m a big Delphi developer, and the recent Delphi tools support Windows &amp; Macintosh, but I imagine other folks would be interested in this thing, so doing it in something that required a commercial software license to maintain didn’t make sense.<\/p>\r\n<p>Next I started thinking about whether I could do it as a Cordova application. Windows is a supported platform for Cordova, so that would work, but Macintosh support is only available pre-3.x. I could probably dig up some work in progress OS X support somewhere, but if it’s not part of the core, it didn’t make sense for me.<\/p>\r\n<p>Then I started thinking about Adobe Brackets. This code editor worked on Windows, OS X and Linux, so they’d clearly picked an approach that worked on each. It’s written using web technologies, so that would work for the app I wanted to build.<\/p>\r\n<p>I started digging into the Brackets code to see how they’d done it. A while back, a colleague convinced me that Brackets was written in PhoneGap, but in reading around on the blogs it quickly became clear that it was created using the Chromium Embedded Framework (<a href=\"https:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/chromiumembedded\/\">https:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/chromiumembedded\/<\/a>).<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2014\/cef-site-640.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>So, I started digging around in the CEF documentation and found a bunch of information. There was an introduction page at <a href=\"https:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/chromiumembedded\/\">https:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/chromiumembedded\/<\/a>, a tutorial at <a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/chromiumembedded\/wiki\/Tutorial\">http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/chromiumembedded\/wiki\/Tutorial<\/a> and some general usage stuff at <a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/chromiumembedded\/wiki\/GeneralUsage.\">http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/chromiumembedded\/wiki\/GeneralUsage.<\/a> Nice! I love it when an open source project has actual guides (that’s one of the things I love about Apache Cordova).<\/p>\r\n<p>I quickly read through all of that material and quickly discovered that after reading all of it, I still didn’t understand how it ‘worked.’ The materials talked about where to download the stuff and how to build it, but nothing about how to ‘use’ it. The tutorial and usage guides talked about threads, callbacks, plugins and all sorts of stuff, but nothing about how to actually ‘use’ it. It’s clear that after I downloaded all of these files, I had something I could run and use, but how did I actually make it do what I wanted it to do?<\/p>\r\n<p>Sigh.<\/p>\r\n<p>I scanned through the stuff again and still didn’t see it. I saw all sorts of source code and highly technical stuff, but not what I needed to know to make an application that did what I wanted to do.<\/p>\r\n<p>Even the Brackets source didn’t help me as it’s just the source code for the app and there was some external process for building it into the actual platform-specific executables. Sigh again.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>Finally, I started searching around again to find some post or article somewhere that told me what I needed to do to make this thing my own. I finally stumbled on an article from Intel at <a href=\"https:\/\/software.intel.com\/en-us\/html5\/blogs\/an-html5-project-with-chromium-embedded-framework.\">https:\/\/software.intel.com\/en-us\/html5\/blogs\/an-html5-project-with-chromium-embedded-framework.<\/a> Here they told me exactly what I needed to do to make the CEF my own – open a configuration file and edit a particular variable to point it to the web application content you want to load.<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2014\/cef-intel-page.png\" height=\"523\" width=\"609\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2<\/p>\r\n<p>Ah ha! That’s what I needed to know. All that other stuff about threads, plugins, callbacks and so on is interesting, and that’s information I’ll eventually need, but for now I simply need to understand how to get started. All those pages of content and somebody simply forgot to add the important part – how to specify what content is loaded into the browser container.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, apparently, for each target platform, you have to specify the content you want loaded in the browser, then use the build process to package it all together into the executable you need. Tada!<\/p>\r\n<p>The issue for me is that developers working on open source projects are so excited about the technical stuff that they skip the getting started stuff and jump to the ‘important’ stuff. So much of the ‘documentation’ out there is written, in my eyes, from the standpoint that you already know how to do this stuff. I’m not kidding, most every time I take a look at one of these projects, I struggle to get past all the unimportant stuff in order to be able to find the simple, everyday, what do I do with this thing.<\/p>\r\n<p>That’s why I write my articles and books the way I do – I assume NOTHING and expect that if you’re brand new to a topic, what I’m providing will give you everything you need. If you’re already familiar with the topic, I expect that you’ll be able to scan the content in order to find interesting tidbits. If you read the reviews of my more recent books on Amazon, you’ll see that people seem to agree.<\/p>\r\n<p>Developers, please listen to me. When you’re documenting your stuff, assume nothing. Let me decide what’s important and what’s important – just document everything STARTING AT THE BEGINNING.<\/p>\r\n<p>Want to hear a little confession from me? I’ve honestly never manipulated an XML document programmatically. Yep, that’s true. Want to know why? Because I could never figure out how to do so. When I first tried to do it in Delphi, there were some tools to help me do it, but no matter how hard I tried, I simply couldn’t find any documentation or example anywhere that showed me how to actually use the tools. The tool documentation clearly explained to me what methods and properties were available, but nowhere could I find anything that showed me how to create an object, assign it to some XML then retrieve properties from it. I’m sorry, but I’ve been a professional software developer for more than 30 years, but sometimes you simply have to show me how things work. I no longer have the patience to hack away at something for hours to figure it out.<\/p>\r\n<p>Back when I was doing Java development on BlackBerry, I was trying to figure out how to use KSOAP (<a href=\"http:\/\/kobjects.org\/ksoap2\/index.html\">http:\/\/kobjects.org\/ksoap2\/index.html<\/a>) to allow an application to consume XML-based web services. Like I said earlier, the docs explained the methods and properties, but never, nowhere, anywhere did it show me how to use any of it in a sentence. I wasn’t a heavy duty Java developer (never have been) so I simply didn’t have the background I need to be able to understand how to use this thing.<\/p>\r\n<p>Again, I could have figured it out, but I had a wife, kids and some books to write, I simply didn’t have the bandwidth to plug through it in order to sort it out myself.<\/p>\r\n<p>I’ll say it again: When you’re documenting your stuff, assume nothing. Let me decide what’s important and what’s important – just document everything STARTING AT THE BEGINNING.<\/p>\r\n<p>JavaDocs can be…useful and interesting, but where’s the sample code? A simple requirement for each and every API, object, property &amp; method is a code sample that shows the target developer how to use the thingie in a sentence. I know that would be boring for the experienced folks, but just don’t look at that stuff. For folks however who are not experienced with the particular technology, someone who knows just a little Java, lay it all out for them so they can use the stuff.<\/p>\r\n<p>OK, on to the Monty Python Reference. So, how is the Chromium Embedded Framework Documentation like a Sketch from Monty Python’s Meaning of Life? The story I just told reminded me of the Sex education sketch (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PqI-28meTZ8\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PqI-28meTZ8<\/a>) from the Monty Python Meaning of Life Movie. I’m not going to try to explain it here, watch the video to see what I’m talking about (warning, it is clearly a very adult topic), but what made me think about the video was the teacher’s comment about ‘why not start her off with a kiss?’<\/p>\r\n<p>When creating documentation for open source projects, start with the simple, give the background beginning users need, before leaping off to the technical details that the more experienced developers need. Both approaches are needed.<\/p>\r\n<p>Start us all off with a simple kiss before doing anything else.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2014-08-04 12:35:08","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2014-08-04 12:38:21","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2014-08-04 12:35:08","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"2","ordering":"54","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"10421","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

I read the instructions, downloaded the code and initiated the command to create a new project.<\/p>\r\n<p>What happened? Failure.<\/p>\r\n<p>I posted my issue on their forum only to be told that my Cordova development environment must be old. I explained that it was all up to date and working perfectly for every other Cordova development I’ve ever done and what I got for my trouble was a link to a video that showed me how to install Ionic on Windows.<\/p>\r\n<p>Sigh. Didn’t I just explain that I have a fully functioning Cordova development environment? Sigh again.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, I started looking around for a potential culprit. My Android dev tools were all up to date and so was my Cordova installation. I noticed that NodeJS was a little old, so I just installed the latest and greatest version of node.<\/p>\r\n<p>When I tried the command again, I got the following…<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2014\/ionic-error-20140811-1.png\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>I have the Ionic tools installed and the command runs. It downloads some stuff, then downloads some more stuff then sets about creating a project and adding some plugins to it. As you can see, it’s able to install two Cordova plugins (device and console), but where it fails is when it’s trying to install a proprietary Ionic plugin.<\/p>\r\n<p>It tells me that there’s the potential that my Cordova is too old, but it’s already been able to install two Cordova plugins without any problems. What could it be about that Ionic plugin that suddenly breaks the Cordova CLI?<\/p>\r\n<p>OK, so we know that my Cordova is up to date and we know that I can add plugins. I’m pretty sure this isn’t a problem with my Cordova implementation – I’ve created Cordova 30 apps or more with this configuration (and written three Cordova books using this config). So what’s the problem?<\/p>\r\n<p>Well, the next thing the Ionic CLI tells me is that my Ionic CLI is out of date and that’s what prompted me to write this blog post.<\/p>\r\n<p>As a developer, when should you check to see that your stuff needs updating? Do you do it before you perform any tasks or do you perform a bunch of tasks, fail, then check to see if there’s a new version of the tool(s)? That was a trick question because the answer to that question is ALLWAYS the first choice – check for application updates BEFORE your tools do anything.<\/p>\r\n<p>That’s the only option that makes sense.<\/p>\r\n<p>Why would you tell me I’m running an older version of a tool only AFTER I’ve tried to use it and failed? Whoever wrote that particular piece of code simply wasn’t paying attention.<\/p>\r\n<p>OK, so I updated the Ionic CLI and ran the command again, only to receive the same error – apparently the Ionic CLI can install Cordova plugins, but not their own as shown below.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2014\/ionic-error-20140811-2.png\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2<\/p>\r\n<p>I’d ask for help again, but I’ve already done that and all I hear back is that I should check to make sure my development environment is up to date.

{"id":"418","asset_id":"474","title":"Bootstrap Complete NavBar Example Application","alias":"bootstrap-navbar-complete","introtext":"<p>I had an idea a while back for a web application I wanted to create. I’d not worked much with Bootstrap (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/getbootstrap.com\/\" rel=\"noopener\">http:\/\/getbootstrap.com\/<\/a>) and wanted to have some experience with it, so I thought I’d play around with building the app I wanted using the framework.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Bootstrap web site is pretty detailed, and I quickly found an application template I could use for my application. As I poked around, I noticed that the template allowed me to add a simple menu to my application and that worked for me. As I played around with it, I found that every single example I could find ANYWHERE for how to use the Bootstrap navbar (the menu) only showed how to create the menu, not anything about how to structure a the page sections within the application that would appear as you selected each menu item. I checked all of the Bootstrap web site, stack overflow and any other site I could find with examples, but there were none that showed a complete example of a complete Bootstrap web application that had a menu.<\/p>\r\n<p>Yet another example of a software project where the documentation for things you don’t already know how to do assume that you already know how to do it. Sigh.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, I found a post on Stack Overflow that showed the JavaScript code needed to process the menu and customized it to suit my needs. The example I found at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/19579083\/bootstrap-how-to-use-navbar\" rel=\"noopener\">http:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/19579083\/bootstrap-how-to-use-navbar<\/a> showed how to deal with a simple menu, but what I implemented, based on the template I was using, had two menus. I also found another Stack Overflow post that described how to set the active menu item in a Bootstrap application at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/11813498\/make-twitter-bootstrap-navbar-link-active\" rel=\"noopener\">http:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/11813498\/make-twitter-bootstrap-navbar-link-active<\/a>. With these two posts, I was able to cobble together what I needed.<\/p>\r\n<p>Let me show you what I created:<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2014\/bootstrap1.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"474\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>As you can see from the image, the navbar has two menus, one on the left (menu 1, menu 2 and menu 3) and one on the right (with settings and an about page). So my JavaScript code has to deal with setting the active menu, no matter which navbar item was selected.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, I’ve posted the example code to GitHub at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/bootstrap-navbar-complete\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/bootstrap-navbar-complete<\/a>.

{"id":"419","asset_id":"475","title":"Poorly Designed Web Sites","alias":"poorly-designed-web-sites","introtext":"<p>As look at the world around me, I&rsquo;m surprised that in the world of the connected, mobile user, that companies are still not thinking of mobile-first users. There are millions or billions of mobile devices sold every year, but companies with public facing web sites still don&rsquo;t seem to notice and I&rsquo;m really surprised by that.<\/p>\r\n<p>The local Charlotte BIG insurance company is Novant Health, and they&rsquo;re usually pretty organized. I was in one of their facilities a while back and noticed that there was free Wi-Fi, so I decided to connect. After selecting the SSID and connecting to the network, I was presented with the confirmation page shown in Figure 1.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2014\/poorly formatted page.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>So, what&rsquo;s happening here is that Novant Health recognized that they had a lot of mobile users within their facility and made a conscious decision to provide them with a little extra service (free Wi-Fi) but made no effort to make the confirmation page friendly to mobile devices. Sigh.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you look at the page, their logo is pretty prominent, but below the fold as it were, so it&rsquo;s not in the way too much. They probably should have used a smaller logo and put it at the top of the page where it is on every other web site they have.<\/p>\r\n<p>The terms of use section is completely unusable. What&rsquo;s interesting about this is that someone had to go out of their way to format the text so that it would be unreadable on a mobile device. Taking the text and wrapping it with paragraph tags would have allowed the content to fill the available page space and made it easily readable, but the developer who did this tried to put it into a fancy, and I think scrollable, window and therefore made it essentially unreadable by a mobile user. Do you see scroll bars or anything that would indicate to me that I can scroll through the text to read all of it before clicking the &lsquo;Accept&rsquo; button?<\/p>\r\n<p>That takes me to the Accept button &ndash; can you even see it? It&rsquo;s so small, that you might not even know it&rsquo;s there. You have to look really, really close to see that there is an &lsquo;I agree with the Policy Above&rsquo; button below the useless text windows. A button that small would be almost impossible to tap with a finger on a smartphone. Apparently I&rsquo;m supposed to read the terms of use (I really can&rsquo;t in this window) and click the button I can hardly see in order to be able to use the Novant Health Wi-Fi network.<\/p>\r\n<p>Like I said, an almost unusable page.<\/p>\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is that it&rsquo;s not that hard to make mobile friendly web pages out of something as simple as this small page. There are hundreds, literally hundreds, of HTML frameworks that could be used to automatically adjust the format of this page to accommodate any size browser and any type of device.<\/p>\r\n<p>Taking the same page content, rendering it as a simple page with no fancy extra windows, just a logo, heading, content and a single button &ndash; would take no effort whatsoever. Just do the tiniest bit of research into HTML5 frameworks, pick one then mark up your text (using proprietary tags for some frameworks and simple CSS tags for others) and you&rsquo;re all done. An extra 5 to 10 minutes of work and suddenly your web page works on any device.<\/p>\r\n<p>For my books, I&rsquo;ve recently been doing a lot of work with Adobe Topcoat and, as a CSS-only solution, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to add the classes to your markup to make a mobile Beautiful page in no time. The same could be said for many other frameworks as well.<\/p>\r\n<p>What I can&rsquo;t understand is why these companies aren&rsquo;t making the effort to do this. It&rsquo;s Wi-Fi, they&rsquo;re giving external users access to a wireless network. They have to know that the majority of users making use of this capability will be doing so from a smartphone or a tablet. There will be some laptops, but in general the majority of visitors won&rsquo;t be bringing laptops with them.<\/p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m assuming they have some sort of tracking capability; that they can tell what systems are using their network &ndash; a little bit of checking would allow them to see what their audience looks like.<\/p>\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s interesting about this example is that it seems that they didn&rsquo;t think to test the site on mobile devices, otherwise they would have seen how useless this page was. In my case, I was using a Samsung Galaxy S4 device &ndash; probably one of the most popular families of Android devices.<br \/>Developers &ndash; Know your audience and code accordingly. There is no need for fancy, small, scrollable windows on a smartphone device. Just wrap ALL of your page&rsquo;s content in &lt;p&gt; tags and let the browser render it exactly as it sees best for the device real estate.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"40","created":"2014-09-16 12:13:49","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2015-04-27 01:08:28","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2014-09-16 12:13:49","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"2","ordering":"5","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"9572","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

Online advice said to whack the site and start over, so that's what I tried to do.<\/p>\r\n<p>I setup a new hosting account then backed up my existing site. Next I tried to restore the existing CMS data into a new CMS installation (of the same CMS software, of course).

Once everything was working, I planned on upgrading everything to the latest version of the CMS software.<\/p>\r\n<p>I didn't spend a lot of time on this (over the last 5 months), but I did take a few vacation days to work on this. The result was that I failed miserably, I simply wasn't able to restore my CMS files into a new CMS installation. The biggest issue I faced is that when I brought up the new site, it 'worked' but when I tried to add my plugins back to the CMS, the legacy installations were still there and it became quite a mess.<\/p>\r\n<p>I tried to manually whack the old plugin installation data (the new CMS didn't actually have the plugins anymore, but the database entries were still there) but that didn't work.

Everything worked (yippee). Next, I upgraded the CMS and almost everything worked. I poked around a bit and fixed the most glaring issues (for me) and completed the migration this evening.<\/p>\r\n<p>The contact form isn't working right now &ndash; I had CAPTCHA problems with it on the old hosting account and now I just need to remember what I did to fix it. I'll work on it this week and will hopefully have things back up and running again. If you need to contact me, my email address is my first name and this site's domain.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"8","created":"2015-04-27 00:37:54","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2015-04-27 00:37:54","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2015-04-27 00:37:54","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"1","ordering":"3","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"10765","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"425","asset_id":"554","title":"Stupid Web Forms","alias":"stupid-web-forms","introtext":"<p>I'm constantly reminded of how web application designers don't pay attention to the impact their decisions have on their application users. I've written here before about this, but I think it's time to bring it up again.<\/p>\r\n<p>When designing a form or dialog, it's important to remember that if you're asking users to make a selection when they first access the site, you should make sure to store that selection so that you don't ask them to make the selection every time. If it's something simple, something the user only needs to address once, most web designers allow the user to make the necessary choice, store the resulting decision and move on. The user's not asked again, so it really doesn't matter how challenging the initial form is if the user is only going to ever use it once.<\/p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, some sites require that the user make a decision or selection every time they access a site or an area in a site. I don't have a problem with that, sometimes it's necessary and the user just has to deal with it. An example of this is shown in Figure 1.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2015\/hsa-web-form.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>Employees that migrated to PayFlex sometime in the past will need to be able to access their pre-PayFlex data as well as their PayFlex data. Makes sense to ask the user which way he or she wants to go, right?<\/p>\r\n<p>In this case, PayFlex has implemented this incorrectly. Whenever you login to the site and try to access this area of the site, you have to make this selection. The problem is that after a while, you'll never need to go back to the old system as all of your current activity is being performed with the PayFlex stuff. OK.<\/p>\r\n<p>The problem I have with this is that the developer who implemented this part of the application didn't make any effort to keep the user's previous selection. It's OK to ask me every time as there's no way for the site to know whether I want to access the old system or the new system. But, once I go down a particular path, it's likely that the next time I access the site I'll want to go the same way again. What they should have done is store the user's decision then preselect that option the next time the user comes into that portion of the site.<\/p>\r\n<p>If going to the same place, all the user has to do is click the continue button (the previous choice will already be selected) and they're golden. If not going to the same place, then all the user has to do is select the other option and click continue to go down that path. By making this simple change, I eliminate, can potentially eliminate 50% of the selections the user has to make on this form. It's either one click or two clicks, but most of the time it will be only one click.<\/p>\r\n<p>By not implementing this simple fix, this company is making every single user make a selection before clicking submit &ndash; EVERY TIME THEY ACCESS THE SITE. This is completely unnecessary and wastes your user's time. You should always be on a lookout for ways to eliminate unnecessary actions by your users.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"40","created":"2015-04-27 01:03:47","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2015-04-27 01:38:42","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2015-04-27 01:03:47","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"3","ordering":"6","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"8752","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"426","asset_id":"556","title":"Leaving SAP","alias":"leaving-sap","introtext":"<p>For those of you that follow me on Twitter or are connected with me on LinkedIn, you probably already know that I no longer work at SAP. This wasn't my idea, instead it was part of an office consolidation that SAP has undertaken. Since I worked in the development organization but wasn't working in an office with my team, my position was eliminated. I live in North Carolina but the people I worked with were in Dublin, CA and Walldorf, Germany so hence the source of the problem.<\/p>\r\n<p>Fortunately for me, SAP made it pretty easy for me. They gave me some time to see if I could find another position with SAP (I didn't). Plus they did some other stuff (which I can't talk about) to help me in my transition. Overall, a stressful but not a very painful process. Bonus!<\/p>\r\n<p>I really liked working at SAP. They treated me very well and I was very happy that I was able to work on software development tools (something that interested me greatly). I really enjoyed working with all of the smart people at SAP. As the Product Manager for what was essentially SAP's hybrid development SDK, I was in the unique position where my day job aligned with my hobby. As a writer about and contributor to the Apache Cordova project, owning some of the Cordova-based products from SAP was the perfect place for me.<\/p>\r\n<p>When I joined SAP, I'd pretty much decided that I was going to stay there until I retired. It was a great job with a great company and I thought I could stay for the duration of my career. Unfortunately, being remote became a problem and I was unwilling to move to California (although I would have been interested in moving to Germany). Over the years, some opportunities presented themselves to me, but, because I wanted to stay at SAP, I didn't really consider them. Now that SAP forced the separation, it gave me some time to pursue some really good opportunities.<\/p>\r\n<p>During this process, I confirmed that only a small percentage of people find jobs on Job Boards; most nowadays find jobs through their existing connections. Once I decided that I wasn't going to find a new position within SAP, I posted on LinkedIn that my position had been eliminated. It wasn't long before my inbox was filled with emails from my existing contact base offering to help me. I quickly updated my resume then responded to everyone. Before long, I'd been introduced to opportunities in about 10 companies and I began actively interviewing with many of them. Of course, nothing came of some of them, but I was able to begin actively working with 6 different companies on 11 different opportunities.<\/p>\r\n<p>I only had a certain amount of time to find a job, so I set a deadline for myself and got to work. I was able to secure 2 job offers a few days past my deadline and had one more lined up, but not formally offered. Essentially, I had three opportunities to choose from. Unfortunately for me, I was really, really interested in all three of them. Sigh. I was hoping I'd have a choice to make (and I succeeded), but I wasn't expecting that I'd be solidly interested in all three of them. Sigh, the pressure increases.<\/p>\r\n<p>For many years, I led custom development (consulting) and product development teams for different organizations. I really enjoyed leading teams. When I got into mobile, I obtained individual contributor roles and had those for the last 10 years or so. With this job&hellip;transition, I pursued some individual contributor roles, but also one where I'd be able to build and (someday) lead a team of technical people. At the end of the day, I had to choose between the three opportunities and I did.<\/p>\r\n<p>I start my new job on Monday &ndash; and will tell you all about it once I start.

{"id":"427","asset_id":"557","title":"Email Input on the Web","alias":"email-input-on-the-web","introtext":"<p>If you access web applications from a smartphone, you may be asked to provide an email address by the application. This will happen during a registration process, but email is also used as a user's user name, so you may find that you have to type an email in every time you log into a site.<\/p>\r\n<p>One of the things that HTML5 gives mobile developers is a special input type for email addresses that simplifies email input for users. Unfortunately, most web developers haven't implemented this cool feature yet, and the result for end users is that every one of us has to work harder to input our email address in these applications.<\/p>\r\n<p>To highlight how this works, I created a sample application that demonstrates the hard way then the easy way to accept email address input in a web application. You'll see screen shots of the application in operation later in the article. You can find the sample application on my GitHub account at <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/email_input\">https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/email_input<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>It seems that most web applications today use the default HTML text input field to capture email addresses:<\/p>\r\n<p>&lt;input type=\"text\"&gt;<\/p>\r\n<p>When the user places the cursor into this field on a mobile device, he or she will see something like what is shown in Figure 1. The user can type anything they want into the input field using the default input keyboard provided by the mobile device.<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2015\/email_input_1_640.png\" height=\"640\" width=\"400\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>As you can see from the figure, even though I'm trying to type in an email address, the browser doesn't know that and the @ symbol used in all email addresses is not readily accessible on the virtual keyboard displayed to the user. It's not too painful to press the ?123 key shown in the figure and select the @ symbol from the secondary keyboard, but it's extra work &ndash; extra work that every user who accesses the form will have to do every time they use the form.<\/p>\r\n<p>With HTML5, there's a special email input field you can invoke using:<\/p>\r\n<p>&lt;input type=\"email\"&gt;<\/p>\r\n<p>With this input type, the mobile browser automatically displays an email address-friendly keyboard as shown in Figure 2.<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2015\/email_input_2_640.png\" height=\"640\" width=\"400\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2<\/p>\r\n<p>With this keyboard, the @ symbol is readily available and the user doesn't need to press any modifier keys to access it. Every single user who uses the form with this input tag has to use one less keypress to enter the email address.<\/p>\r\n<p>This isn't an earth shattering reduction in keystrokes, but at least with this approach an attempt is made to simplify things for users. Developers should always look for ways to simplify things for their users and this is a great example.<\/p>\r\n<p>It's not a lot of work to implement this, simply change the input type from text to email. Now, many of you may be asking yourself what the impact is for browsers that don't support the HTML5 input tags. Well, HTML5 as a draft has been around long enough that you'll be hard pressed to find a modern smartphone that doesn't support them. However, for those browsers, if the email type isn't supported, the browser will simply ignore the tag and render the default input field.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, there's no impact on users if the tag isn't supported by the browser, but direct benefit to smartphone users if it is. There's no reason not to update all of your email input fields to use this input tag right away.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"14","created":"2015-04-28 20:11:26","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2015-04-28 20:13:02","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2015-04-28 20:11:26","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"2","ordering":"21","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"10103","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"428","asset_id":"558","title":"Apache Cordova 4 Programming Now Available","alias":"apache-cordova-4-programming-now-available","introtext":"<p>My latest book, Apache Cordova 4 Programming (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cordova4programming.com\">www.cordova4programming.com<\/a>), is now available in stores. This is my 7<sup>th<\/sup> book overall and my 4<sup>th<\/sup> book on Apache Cordova\/Adobe PhoneGap.<\/p>\r\n<p>The book is written for mobile developers who want to learn about Apache Cordova 4. If you&rsquo;re brand new to Cordova, then this book will be just what you need to get started. If you&rsquo;re experienced with an older version of Cordova, this book can act as a refresher plus will show you in detail how to use all of the new stuff that&rsquo;s in Cordova 4. You will need to have at least some experience with mobile development to directly benefit from this book. The target audience could be existing web developers who want to get into mobile development, but much of the needed native mobile development background just isn&rsquo;t in here. Sorry!<\/p>\r\n<p>What you&rsquo;ll find in the book:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Lots of detailed information about Apache Cordova, what it does, how it works and how to use the available tools and APIs<\/li>\r\n<li>Lots of examples and code; for even more code, be sure to check out my <i>Apache Cordova API Cookbook<\/i> (www.cordovacookbook.com)<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>What you won&rsquo;t find in this book:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Mobile web development and mobile development topics; this is a book about Apache Cordova, not mobile development<\/li>\r\n<li>Expressions or phrases in languages other than English (I hate it when authors include expressions from Latin or French)<\/li>\r\n<li>Obscure references to pop- culture topics (although there is an overt reference to Douglas Adams&rsquo; <i>Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy<\/i> and one obscure reference to Monty Python)<\/li>\r\n<li>Pictures of my children or my pets<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>This book is not a book for experienced Cordova 4 developers &ndash; if you consider yourself an experienced Cordova 4 developer, then you probably should not buy this book.<\/p>\r\n<p>Herein I tried to provide complete coverage of Apache Cordova 4; covering enough detail that readers will leave with a complete understanding of what Cordova is, what it does, how it works and how to use it for their mobile application projects. There&rsquo;s a whole lot more to Cordova, many advance topics and more detailed coverage of the Cordova APIs which is covered in the Cordova documentation or in blogs.<\/p>\r\n<p>This book started many years ago as a book called <i>PhoneGap Essentials<\/i> (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.phonegapessentials.com\">www.phonegapessentials.com<\/a>); the book was all about PhoneGap 2.0 and was published right about the time the project name changed to Apache Cordova. The book weighed in at about 300 pages long. The book&rsquo;s first 150 pages covered the available tools and everything a developer needed to know to configure a development environment then create, write, build and test PhoneGap applications. The second half of the book provided a detailed deep dive into each of the (at the time) PhoneGap APIs. The cool part of this second half was that it included, for each API, at least one complete, functional sample application that demonstrated each aspect of the API. The framework&rsquo;s documentation was pretty useful in demonstrating how the API worked overall, but PhoneGap Essentials provided much more thorough examples.<\/p>\r\n<p>The book went on to become the bestselling book on the topic and it was used in university courses around the world. According to Amazon.com, people are still purchasing this book today.<\/p>\r\n<p>With the release of Apache Cordova 3, I reworked the manuscript and published <i>Apache Cordova 3 Programming<\/i> (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cordovaprogramming.com\">www.cordovaprogramming.com<\/a>). This book also weighed in at 300 pages, but was essentially a rewrite of just the first half of PhoneGap Essentials with only cursory coverage of the Cordova APIs provided. This allowed me to go into much more details on the tools and development process.<\/p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, the book was only available as an ebook, so most readers didn&rsquo;t even know it existed. This was exacerbated by Amazon&rsquo;s refusal to link a printed book to an updated version in a different format; I could point people interested in the ebook version of <i>PhoneGap Essentials<\/i> to the ebook version of <i>Apache Cordova 3 Programming<\/i>, but I could not do the same for the printed version. The side effect of this was that people continued to buy <i>PhoneGap Essentials<\/i> even though it covered an older version of the framework.<\/p>\r\n<p>In order to accommodate those readers who were more interested in the Cordova APIs, I reworked the second half of <i>PhoneGap Essentials<\/i> into another 300 pages called <i>Apache Cordova API Cookbook<\/i> (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cordovacookbook.com\">www.cordovacookbook.com<\/a>). In this book, the complete example applications from PhoneGap Essentials were enhanced and expanded and all of the book&rsquo;s content updated for the newer version of Cordova. I&rsquo;d not covered some topics as well as I would have liked in the first book, so this update allowed me to really expand the coverage of some topics and include even more complete sample applications (32 I think it was).<\/p>\r\n<p>Between <i>Apache Cordova 3 Programming<\/i> and <i>Apache Cordova API Cookbook<\/i>, I had written more than 600 pages of coverage of Apache Cordova 3. That&rsquo;s more than twice the size of the original book and a lot of good information for developers.<\/p>\r\n<p>With this book, I&rsquo;ve updated <i>Apache Cordova 3 Programming<\/i> for Apache Cordova 4 plus included new content on a bunch of topics. In my previous books, I focused primarily on PhoneGap and Apache Cordova; I didn&rsquo;t cover many third-party tools and left many mobile development topics uncovered as well. For this book, there were a bunch of additional tools available and some hybrid-focused HTML frameworks so I decided to cover as many of them as I could in the space available to me. Where this book&rsquo;s predecessor was 300 pages, this one should top out at over 500 pages, so there&rsquo;s a lot of really good information here for all types of Cordova developers. When bundled with Apache Cordova API Cookbook, you&rsquo;ll have more than 800 pages of information about Apache Cordova.<\/p>\r\n<p>Herein you&rsquo;ll find most of the same topics as were covered in <i>Apache Cordova 3 Programming<\/i>, the only missing topic is coverage of the BlackBerry platform. I wrote the first book on BlackBerry development and had pretty much always carried a BlackBerry device, but between books BlackBerry experienced a dramatic drop in market share and I started carrying an Android device as my primary device. Additionally, in previous books I had the enthusiastic support of my former colleagues at BlackBerry, but when it came time to get feedback on the BlackBerry chapter in <i>Apache Cordova 3 Programming<\/i>, the development team stopped responding to my inquiries. Because of those two things I decided to drop support for BlackBerry from this book.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, what new stuff have I added in this book?

{"id":"429","asset_id":"559","title":"Becoming an App Guy","alias":"becoming-an-app-guy","introtext":"<p>It seems like I'm becoming more of an app guy lately. It was an interesting realization for me as it's surprising that I've been in mobile for 10 years, but just now seem to be getting into apps.<\/p>\r\n<p>Of course, spending some time thinking about it, it's not surprising.<\/p>\r\n<p>My entry into mobile was through BlackBerry; I was a Technical Manager, Applications &ndash; meaning that I helped customers understand how they could build apps for the BlackBerry platform. I was a developer supporting developers and, at the time, not much was available for consumers, it was all enterprise apps. Since enterprise required having access to back-end enterprise data, and I didn't use any enterprise apps at the time, not much was available to me.<\/p>\r\n<p>Next I headed over to BoxTone (now part of Good Technologies) and was focusing on BlackBerry server performance and BlackBerry device performance. Not many apps for me to rely upon. That and I was a BlackBerry guy as the world abandoned BlackBerry, so even less interest in apps.<\/p>\r\n<p>At AT&amp;T, I was part of a sales team selling mobile application platforms. These were Mobile Enterprise Application Platforms (MEAP) and Mobile Consumer Application Platforms (MCAP) which was all eventually renamed to Mobile Application Development Platforms (MADP). In my focus on platforms, I knew how to build apps for the Antenna, Pyxis (now Verivo) and Kony platforms, but was so busy with development stuff, that I really didn't use a lot of apps. That and working for a carrier, I was constantly switching phones; switching between BlackBerry, Android, iOS and Windows phones &ndash; there was really no way for me to use a big app catalog with my device in flux.<\/p>\r\n<p>At this point, I started using and writing about Apache Cordova and Adobe PhoneGap and therefore had a ton of sample hybrid apps on my devices, but none of them helped me much in my day to day activities.<\/p>\r\n<p>Next was SAP and I was fortunate enough to be a product manager for part of a mobile development SDK and again focused on helping enterprises build their mobile apps. For a while, I stayed on BlackBerry, but eventually switched to Android. I started using more and more Android apps, but ultimately I stopped traveling so had less need for apps as I moved around.<\/p>\r\n<p>During my transition from SAP, I started having trouble with my Android phone, so I activated a Windows Phone device that Microsoft was kind enough to give me as I worked on my last book. I struggled a bit with the device since some of the apps I found to be critical (like the Sonos app and the Amazon Echo app) weren't available on Windows Phone. Time to switch back to Android.<\/p>\r\n<p>I'm getting ready to make a BIG career change and because the company I'll be working with supports a bring your own device (BYOD) environment, I had to buy my very first smartphone (the first one I ever paid for) and my second iPad. I've been reading some books lately on mobile apps and I started researching more apps and loading them on my device. I think the quality and quantity of apps available to consumers is great. I think the separate app for each activity or relationship is a flawed approach, but I'm enjoying getting all of these apps and making them a part of my daily routine.<\/p>\r\n<p>Already, I'm finding myself spending more and more time with the following apps:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Sonos: controlling the music that surrounds me<\/li>\r\n<li>Pandora: when I want to listen to music when I only have my tablet or smartphone near<\/li>\r\n<li>Zinio: Unfortunately, a few of the publications I read are ONLY available in electronic format; I HATE that.<\/li>\r\n<li>Pocket<\/li>\r\n<li>Flipboard: I LOVE flipboard, that's how I get all my news now<\/li>\r\n<li>Evernote<\/li>\r\n<li>Amazon<\/li>\r\n<li>Banking and Credit card apps: direct deposit is way overdue.<\/li>\r\n<li>Dropbox<\/li>\r\n<li>Google Drive and apps<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>I used to hate the zinio app, but it's gotten better although it's still flawed in a great many ways, at least it works most of the time (which is an improvement).<\/p>\r\n<p>There's a bunch more, but you see my point. So many aspects of my day are enhanced through the information provided by these apps. Notice that I'm not playing games &ndash; too much other stuff to do.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2015-05-01 13:00:00","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2015-04-30 13:26:01","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2015-05-01 13:00:00","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"1","ordering":"48","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"7910","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"430","asset_id":"560","title":"The Stupidity of Security Questions","alias":"the-stupidity-of-security-questions","introtext":"<p>We have an Amazon Echo and I love it. It was a pretty frustrating process getting one, but that's for another post.<\/p>\r\n<p>Today I thought that Mother's Day was tomorrow. My wife informed me that it's not tomorrow, it's next week. Dodged a bullet there. I've been experimenting with the Echo, trying to understand what she understands and what she doesn't. Did you know you can get her to stop playing music by telling her 'Shutup b#tch'? That surprised me, but at the same time, didn't. Anyway, I asked her when Mother's Day was and she told me it was the second Sunday in May. I didn't know that, so it was nice to have that detail. I really wanted the date, so I asked her \"What date is the second Sunday in May\". She didn't understand my query for some reason. As you can see, I didn't ask her what I really wanted to know, so my fault for her getting it wrong. What I really wanted to know was the date for Mother's Day, perhaps I should have asked her that.<\/p>\r\n<p>I was looking at the echo app a little while later and noticed that the app was showing me what she heard and asking whether she got it right. What she heard was \"What is the second Sunday in Maine?\" Close, but wrong. I indicated in the app that she got it wrong and once I did that, a pop-up, well, popped-up asking if I wanted to provide more feedback, so I said yes and entered what I was trying to search for in the input field. When I clicked Submit (or whatever it was) apparently it sent an email to Amazon with my feedback.<\/p>\r\n<p>Cool stuff, get me to help them tune her algorithm. It's Google Voice all over again.<\/p>\r\n<p>What happened next is where it got&hellip;weird. A few minutes later, I get a call from an Amazon Echo support person wanting to talk with me about my issue. That's cool; not what I expected, but cool.<\/p>\r\n<p>As I started to talk to the guy, he said he couldn't talk to me until I confirmed the answers to some security questions. What? You called me and you want ME to confirm the answers to some security questions? Nope, no way &ndash; refuse to do it.<\/p>\r\n<p>It's a closed loop, from the Amazon Echo app to Amazon support all the way back to me. What value is there in me proving that I'm who I say I am? You called me, right? I don't have an issue when I call them and they need my security questions answered in order for me to prove I'm me. But when you call me, I really don't feel inclined to confirm to you I'm who I say I am.<\/p>\r\n<p>You called the number you have for me in your system and I answered. I'm not trying to make any purchases or change anything on the account, you're merely calling me about some feedback I provided you on the accuracy of the Amazon Echo's text recognition algorithms. No need for security questions in this case.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, just on principal, I refused to answer the security questions and explained why (that it was simply a matter of principal and I generally refuse to do stupid things unless I have no other choice). After I hung up, I thought about something. Answering the security questions IS a security issue &ndash; what if my email from the Echo app was intercepted (I can't understand why Amazon would use email for this and not a secure HTTPS connection through the app) and the phone call was a Phishing attempt to get my answers to my security questions so they can use them to impersonate me? Nope, not doing it.<\/p>\r\n<p>What do you think? Am I crazy?

{"id":"431","asset_id":"561","title":"Is Amazon Listening?","alias":"is-amazon-listening","introtext":"<p>I've been having a conversation lately with a former colleague about voice control of physical devices. As I mentioned yesterday, I purchased an Amazon Echo and just love the way it's transformed my kitchen. My family is playing music, setting timers, checking the weather and adding fun and interesting things to the shopping list.<\/p>\r\n<p>I'm struggling a bit because I want to be able to control another device in my house using the Echo. My former colleague works for the company that makes that other device and I've been trying to understand their plans for either integration with the Echo or direct voice recognition in their device.<\/p>\r\n<p>I initially thought that I wanted the Echo to control everything, but then I realized that I will probably only have an Echo in my kitchen and I have other products all throughout the house that I want to be able to talk to (thermostats, streaming music players, lights, locks and so on). While I really don't want different voice control systems to learn the syntax for, I realize that there's likely not going to be a way to have a single source of control unless I do put an Echo in every room. At $199 each, that would be a challenge.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, during these conversations with my former colleague, it became clear that there are privacy some concerns about the Echo. In my mind, the Echo is sitting there idly listening for its command word, and only then does it wake up and listen to what else you've said. It's possible that the Echo is listening to everything we say, but is that really something that's important to Amazon?<\/p>\r\n<p>The amount of data being processed and uploaded to Amazon would be staggering. Now, they could be listening for key phrases, keywords as it were, and sending them up, but again, that could be a seriously large amount of data as well.<\/p>\r\n<p>I think of bigger concern is that someone could hack the Echo and then start listening to everything we say. The government would be a good candidate for that as would anyone in the industrial espionage area, but is this really something we need to actually worry about? I think the answer to that is both no and yes.<\/p>\r\n<p>No, I don't think Amazon is listening to everything we say. Well, that's not correct, the Echo IS listening to everything we say, but it's not 'using' any of it until after it hears someone say 'Alexa.' However, I really don't have any concrete proof of that &ndash; it's only what I figured out myself as I thought about how the Echo works. I don't think we need to worry about this as I trust Amazon to do the right thing. However, I should probably assume nothing and actually find out what they do so that I can be better prepared.<\/p>\r\n<p>Yes, I think we should worry about this. Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean someone's not out to get you. We already have voice control in Google Now and Siri and my 8-year old automobile has a voice control module although the car is not Internet connected. However, we are about to start putting voice control devices all throughout the house and eventually everywhere else.<\/p>\r\n<p>I've read a few books about the NSA and what Edward Snowden did, so I'd be surprised if the Government didn't start listening to that stuff as well (looking for keywords of course, then digging deeper). Again, I'm not paranoid, but I do believe in having reasonable expectations. If the NSA is really looking at all of our Facebook and Twitter posts, and listening to our phone calls, then how much of a stretch is it to imagine them hacking into our houses and listening through these voice-control devices?<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2015-05-03 13:00:49","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2015-05-03 13:00:49","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2015-05-03 13:00:49","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"1","ordering":"46","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"7853","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

{"id":"433","asset_id":"565","title":"The Challenge Getting an Amazon Echo","alias":"the-challenge-getting-an-amazon-echo","introtext":"<p>For years I've wanted to be able to use voice to interact with the systems around me. I want to be able to talk to my computer as I'm working and in the house I want to be able to interact with everything in my house as I do things. I'm spoiled, I guess, by all of the Science Fiction books and stories I've read throughout the years.<\/p>\r\n<p>I first got interested in this when I heard about Wildfire, a virtual assistant that ran within your computer. What was interesting about Wildfire (as I understand it) was that it was essentially a PC on a card that sat inside your PC and processed all voice inputs then acted on them. It was expensive and essentially required that you had two PC's, one inside the other.<\/p>\r\n<p>I've waited and waited and waited for a system that I could just&hellip; interact with. I tried Dragon Naturally Speaking (didn't work for me) and constantly watched the industry for my perfect solution.<\/p>\r\n<p>Much later, we got Google Now and Siri, both very capable voice interaction systems. They're awesome and very useful, but this isn't something I want on my mobile device, I want it in my surroundings &ndash; everywhere. Anyway, with these smartphone-controlled systems, they work great and save me a lot of hassle when I need to get something done and I'm tied up.<\/p>\r\n<p>The problem is that I have to dig my phone out of my pocket to use it and that's not always possible. I carry my phone with me when I'm away from the house, but generally it's on my desk during the day (while I'm working) and still there when I go 'home' at the end of the day. I'm old, I didn't grow up keeping my phone with me at all times. Also, having worked at BlackBerry and being constantly connected taught me that I should put it down every night and ignore anything on it until the morning. I laugh when people call my mobile at night instead of just using my home number &ndash; not likely to catch me on the mobile at night unless I'm out of the house.<\/p>\r\n<p>Another aspect of this is that I ultimately needed something that anyone in my family could use at any time. My wife doesn't carry her phone around with her when she's in the house either, and we have two children that don't have mobile phones, so we needed something that went with the house, not a person.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, this is a post about the Amazon Echo so I'd better get to it, right?<\/p>\r\n<p>Last November, Amazon announced the Amazon Echo &ndash; a voice interactive system that sits on a counter or desk and waits to act upon your every command. Simply say \"Alexa\" (or \"Echo\") and she'll respond and try to deliver an answer to any question you give her or act upon any command she understands. I LOVED the idea and immediately (like 30 minutes after the announcement) requested access.<\/p>\r\n<p>I waited. And continued to wait. I waited a really long time (more than a month) and never heard anything back from them. Disappointed.<\/p>\r\n<p>About a month later, I had some family in town and mentioned the Echo to my brother. He immediately hopped online and requested his Echo. I assumed, wrongly, that since I got on the list day-one, that I'd get my Echo WAY before he did, so I didn't worry about letting him in on my little Echo secret.<\/p>\r\n<p>Wrong! He got his Echo about a week or so later. Ugh!<\/p>\r\n<p>Apparently, much to my chagrin, Amazon RANDOMLY selected the people who got the early Echos. I'm not sure they told me that when I requested mine, but who reads those disclaimers anyway, right? So, unlike most any get your new product process and most any product ordering scenario, Amazon didn't deal with requests on a FIFO basis, they simply randomly pulled names out and sent them their Echo's.<\/p>\r\n<p>This was really frustrating. I wanted something like the Echo for so long and I was finally going to get my chance, but there was pretty much no way for me to get one. Sigh.<\/p>\r\n<p>I started surveying my friends and found out that many other people got theirs &ndash; most having requested theirs after I requested mine.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, like any able bodied American, I started complaining. I emailed Amazon Customer Service and was politely told that it was a random selection process. Frustrating. I started tweeting about it, making as public of a scene as I could without tarnishing my name to much and within about a week or so, Amazon sent me an email with information that would 'allow' me to order an Echo. I plunked down my order as fast as I could only to learn that my Echo wouldn't ship for months. Everybody else requested theirs, got an email allowing them to order very quickly then got their Echo in no time. For me, I had to wait months for an invite then another set of months to actually receive it.<\/p>\r\n<p>Not really handled very well by Amazon.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, I finally got my Echo and I LOVE it. I'll write more about it here when I get a chance.<\/p>\r\n<p>As much as I'm complaining about Amazon, I understand why they did what they wanted.

I&rsquo;d read several of Simon&rsquo;s books (<i>Programming the BeagleBone Black<\/i> and <i>Make: Getting Started with the Photon<\/i>). I&rsquo;ve enjoyed his books, and they&rsquo;ve helped me learn how to work with the Photon and BeagleBone Black.<\/p>\r\n<p>I travel a lot and when I&rsquo;m trying to learn something, I prefer to pick up a book and work through the book step by step. Online documentation is OK, especially when you&rsquo;re trying to find a quick fix to something, but I find that books are better at the overall learning you need when you first start working with a hardware device, developer tool or programming language. There&rsquo;s something about the structure of a book vs. poking around in product documentation that makes it easier for me to learn from a book.<\/p>\r\n<p>This book is different &ndash; instead of working with a specific hardware device, he&rsquo;s picked a theme for this one and targeted all of the book&rsquo;s projects to that theme. In this case, it&rsquo;s all about some projects you can do that will help you survive the Zombie Apocalypse (ZA). Overall, he&rsquo;s done a good job in selecting useful projects and connecting them well with the theme. The good news is that even though he&rsquo;s working with a theme, and having some fun with the whole Zombie aspect of it, he doesn&rsquo;t overdo it. The ZA attitude and the jokes that accompany it are fun and not overdone. I especially liked the web cam example image that included a Zombie in it &ndash; a nice and fun touch.<\/p>\r\n<p>The good thing about this themed approach is that he&rsquo;s crafted a series of useful projects then tied them together with a single management console. Each project can be built separately, but when you follow the theme and get them all working together through the console, you get a feel for how more complicated projects can work.<\/p>\r\n<p>Since he&rsquo;s focusing on a series of projects and not a specific hardware device, you get to see how to implement projects on different hardware platforms (Most projects are on the Arduino, but the Raspberry Pi shows up as well).<\/p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, his parts lists don&rsquo;t take into account that you might not be adding a particular project to another existing project that already has some parts. I found myself looking at the shopping list and thinking that things were missing only to discover later that he&rsquo;s expecting this particular project to be added to another. I would have preferred a complete list of parts that were somehow marked to indicate &ldquo;You may already have this part if you&rsquo;re adding this to that other project.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not a big deal, but it did cause me some pause as I tried to figure out which parts were needed to complete the whole project.<\/p>\r\n<p>The thing I liked the most about this book compared to the others I&rsquo;d read is the length of the book. Since he wasn&rsquo;t doing a quick hit on a specific hardware device, he spent more time (pages) covering the background material in detail before showing how to make the report. I especially liked the chapter on survival tips for the ZA: Chapter 1 &ndash; Apocalypse Basics. In this chapter he covers some basic survival requirements before jumping into the skills you need to make the projects. In the second chapter, he talks about how to generate electricity and provides a lot of good background about electricity and battery life. The value of this for many readers will be when they&rsquo;re trying to build something with similar (but different parts); the material he provides makes it easy for the reader to figure out how his stuff will work compared to what Monk shows in the book. He did a really good job showing how to make use of the flash in a pile of discarded (empty) disposable cameras.<\/p>\r\n<p>Of all the microcontroller projects book I&rsquo;ve read (and I&rsquo;ve read a bunch), this book had more practical material (background and project) than most others. There are real world applications for each of the projects described herein. Additionally, the none of the projects were that hard, I knew I had the skills for each. I&rsquo;m looking forward to see what he does next.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2016-01-18 20:59:49","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2016-01-18 21:03:28","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2016-01-18 20:59:49","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/2016\\\/zombie_cover.gif\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/2016\\\/zombie_cover.gif\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"2","ordering":"39","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"6698","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

That is, after all, the definition (source <a href=\"http:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/troll\">http:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/troll<\/a>):<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>To fish with a hook and line that you pull through the water<\/li>\r\n<li>To search for or try to get (something)<\/li>\r\n<li>To search through (something)<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>Sometimes a word is just a word and the classic definition of the word&hellip;simply&hellip;works. In this case, there&rsquo;s trolling for fish and, the other, bad, Internet Troll. In this case, I&rsquo;m pretty sure my context is clear; as you read the sentence, does it feel to you that I&rsquo;m announcing to the world that I monitor Stack Overflow and Google Groups looking for people to attack verbally? Or, more reasonably, did I intend to mean that I&rsquo;m, as per the Merriam Webster dictionary definition above, searching through something?<\/p>\r\n<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to use words simply because of one, unofficial, interpretation of the word. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.urbandictionary.com\/define.php?term=trolling\">urban dictionary<\/a>, for example, completly ignores the actual definition of the word and instead leads with the bad Internet Troll interpretation of the word. I bet that many people don&rsquo;t actually know the true meaning of troll; the Urban Dictionary&rsquo;s manipulation of the definition doesn&rsquo;t help either.<\/p>\r\n<p>We have to stop looking for things to be offended about; people are way, way too sensitive nowadays and it&rsquo;s getting a little ridiculous. As George Carlin famously said: &ldquo;There are bad thoughts, bad intentions, and words.&rdquo; I&rsquo;d like to amend that to the following: &ldquo;There are bad thoughts, bad intentions, actions and words.&rdquo; Judge me on my actions or the reasonable assessment of my words; not the potential, unreasonable interpretation of a word. Reasonable people will likely assume the least offensive meaning of my use of trolling until I prove otherwise.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2016-02-08 18:31:06","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2016-02-08 22:40:19","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2016-02-08 22:34:48","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"4","ordering":"38","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"7322","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"442","asset_id":"583","title":"WebStorm Development on the Raspberry Pi","alias":"webstorm-development-on-the-raspberry-pi","introtext":"<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on a Particle Photon-powered garage door opener project with my son; I&rsquo;d found an example project online somewhere (I can&rsquo;t remember where, otherwise I&rsquo;d post a link here) and looked pretty interesting. I, of course, modified it and put my own twist on the project. I&rsquo;ll write about the project once it&rsquo;s completed. The project&rsquo;s pretty simple and it&rsquo;s all ready to assemble (plus the code is all written).<\/p>\r\n<p>I came up with a few features I wanted for the opener that I couldn&rsquo;t implement on the Photon, so I decided to do a V2 on the Raspberry Pi. I&rsquo;ve got the hardware all figured out and I wanted to create a node-based server process running on the Pi to control everything. I love working with the Pi, but I honestly don&rsquo;t want to write code on it. The editors I&rsquo;m comfortable with aren&rsquo;t compatible and the system&rsquo;s just not fast enough for the dev stuff I want to do. So, for this server project, I started thinking of how I could use my PC to code everything, but also maintain a quick and easy way to publish code to the Pi for execution and testing.<\/p>\r\n<p>My JavaScript\/Node editor of choice is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.jetbrains.com\/webstorm\/\">WebStorm from JetBrains<\/a>, so my plan was to code in WebStorm then transmit the files to the Pi. Once that was in place, I needed a quick way to restart my code so the new version of the server was available for testing. One thought was to use GitHub as an intermediary for this, but that seemed slow and clunky. Next I figured I could use FTP to post the files to the Pi. Thinking that manually FTPing the files to the Pi would be a pain, I started looking at what WebStorm could do. It turns out that WebStorm supports SSH, so I was able to quickly setup a publishing target in WebStorm that allowed me to easily deploy changes to the Pi.<\/p>\r\n<p>What follows are instructions on how to setup WebStorm to publish code directly to the Pi.<\/p>\r\n<h1>Implementation &ndash; Enabling SSH<\/h1>\r\n<p>The first step in the process is to enable SSH on the Pi. It&rsquo;s fairly easy to do this, simply open the Raspberry Pi Configuration utility (open the Pi menu and select Preferences, then Raspberry Pi Configuration). In the dialog that appears (Figure 1), select the Interfaces tab then enable SSH as shown in the figure. When you click the OK button, the Pi will reboot with SSH enabled.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/raspberry_pi_configuration.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1 &ndash; Raspberry Pi Configuration Application Interfaces Tab<\/p>\r\n<p>The next thing you need to do is figure out how your desktop development environment will connect to the Pi. WebStorm needs to know how to reach the Pi; you could enable DNS and use the Pi&rsquo;s name to connect to it, but that&rsquo;s more complicated than I wanted for this project. Instead, I decided to connect to the Pi using the device&rsquo;s IP address. There are several ways to determine the Pi&rsquo;s IP address. A quick look at the Pi documentation told me I could use the following command to determine the IP address:<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"><code>hostname<\/code> -I<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>So, I opened a terminal window on the Pi and typed in the command and received the results shown in Figure 2. The first time I did this (OK, it was a couple of times) I didn&rsquo;t get the results I wanted. I&rsquo;d type in the command, but I&rsquo;d get back an IP address of 127.0.1.1 which is a local address (only accessible from the PI) and something that wouldn&rsquo;t work for me. I finally figured out the problem, I used a lower case i and that got me completely different results.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/raspberry_pi_hostname.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2 &ndash; Using the hostname command to determine the Pi IP address<\/p>\r\n<p>Another way to get the IP address is to execute the following terminal command:<\/p>\r\n<p><code><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">sudo ifconfig<\/span><\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>With this command, you get the results shown in Figure 3.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/raspberry_pi_ifconfig.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 3 &ndash; Using the ifconfig command to determine the PI IP address<\/p>\r\n<p>Using either approach, I quickly determined my device&rsquo;s IP address (192.168.1.92). With that in place, I&rsquo;m ready to configure WebStorm.<\/p>\r\n<h1>Configuring WebStorm<\/h1>\r\n<p>Now that I know how to reach my Pi and the SSH software is installed, it&rsquo;s time to configure my WebStorm project to publish my code to it. In WebStorm, open the Tools menu, select Deployment then Configuration; you should see a dialog similar to the one shown in Figure 4.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/webstorm_pi_1_640.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 4 &ndash; Configuring a Connection in WebStorm<\/p>\r\n<p>The first thing you&rsquo;ll want to do is click the green plus sign in the upper-left corner of the dialog. By clicking on it, you&rsquo;re instructing WebStorm to create a new connection. When the new connection appears (it will take up the right side of the dialog as shown in the figure), do the following:<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Set the connection type to SFTP as shown in the figure.<\/li>\r\n<li>Specify the Pi&rsquo;s IP address as the SFTP host.<\/li>\r\n<li>Leave port alone; port 22 is the default port for SSH and the Raspberry Pi will use it by default.<\/li>\r\n<li>For Root Path, you can type in the full path pointing to the Pi user&rsquo;s home folder if you know what it is. I didn&rsquo;t know, so I clicked the Autodetect button and it filled it in for me.<\/li>\r\n<li>Specify the User name defined on the Pi. The default user name is &ldquo;pi&rdquo; and the default password is &ldquo;raspberry&rdquo; &ndash; if you&rsquo;ve changed the default user settings on the Pi, make sure you enter the correct values here. Set Auth type to Password as shown in the figure.<\/li>\r\n<li>Be sure to check the Save password checkbox if you don&rsquo;t want to have to type in the password every time you deploy your code to the Pi.<\/li>\r\n<li>At this point, you should have everything you need to connect &ndash; click the Test SFTP connection button to validate the settings you&rsquo;ve entered. If the test fails, you&rsquo;ll have to tweak the settings until everything&rsquo;s right.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve validated the connection, switch over to the Mappings tab shown in Figure 5.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/webstorm_pi_2_640.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 5 &ndash; Mapping the local file system to the remote host<\/p>\r\n<p>The Local path field should be populated with your current WebStorm project folder. This field specifies the source folder for the deployment.<\/p>\r\n<p>In the Deployment path on server &lsquo;Pi&rsquo; field, enter the home folder path where you want the files deployed. For my configuration, the user&rsquo;s home folder is located in \/home\/pi, so with the deployment path shown in the figure, the files will be deployed to \/home\/pi\/dev\/pi_garage_door_server.<\/p>\r\n<p>There will be files\/folders in my project&rsquo;s source folder that I don&rsquo;t want copied over to the Pi, do I used the Excluded Paths tab to specify the content I wanted excluded as shown in Figure 6.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/webstorm_pi_3_640.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 6 &ndash; Excluding folders published to the Pi<\/p>\r\n<p>In this case, I wanted to be able to manually install any modules I needed on the Pi, rather than using the ones from my dev environment. I clicked the Add local path button and selected the node_modules folder from my project.<\/p>\r\n<p>Click the OK button when finished.<\/p>\r\n<h1>Deploying the Project Files<\/h1>\r\n<p>With everything in place, you can deploy the project files to the Pi in two ways:<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Open the WebStorm Tools menu, select Deployment then the Upload to Pi option<\/li>\r\n<li>Right-click on the project folder in WebStorm then, in the pop-up menu that appears, select Deployment then the Upload to Pi option<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>WebStorm will open a File transfer window and show you the status of the file transfer as it progresses.<\/p>\r\n<h1>Conclusion<\/h1>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s it, that&rsquo;s all there is to configuring WebStorm to deploy files to the Raspberry Pi. To test my code, I&rsquo;ll need to keep a SSH window open, connected to the Pi, to execute the server code. Ultimately, when the code&rsquo;s stable, I will configure my server to reload itself after every execution, so all I&rsquo;ll have to do is refresh my browser window twice to load the new code I&rsquo;ve deployed. More on the server process later.

The book targeted PhoneGap 2 and since then many things have changed. PhoneGap was changed to Apache Cordova the PhoneGap became Adobe&rsquo;s distribution of Apache Cordova (with some extra things added). As Apache Cordova and PhoneGap are both now at version 6, it didn&rsquo;t seem appropriate to maintain a site dealing with technologies 4 versions back.<\/p>\r\n<p>Since the book was published, I have published multiple updates to the book.

{"id":"445","asset_id":"586","title":"Xmas Jam 2015 Epic Failure","alias":"xmas-jam-2015-epic-failure","introtext":"<p>I’m a huge fan of everything Warren Haynes does; a friend of mine introduced me to Gov’t Mule many, many years ago and since then I’ve purchased every one of his CDs and attended every concert I can (solo, Mule, Allman Brothers).<\/p>\r\n<p>When I moved to North Carolina, I was surprised to learn that he has a yearly charity concert called the Christmas Jam just a few hours’ drive away. I quickly bought tickets, found someone to watch the kids and my wife and I headed off to the show. We loved it.<\/p>\r\n<p>In case you haven’t heard about this show before, here’s a little background. Warren is from Asheville, and every year he hosts a benefit concert for Habitat for Humanity. A bunch of bands come into town and essentially this show takes over the town. The show starts at 7 PM or so and runs until every band has had a chance to play. The first time we attended, Greg Allman started playing at 2 – we watched half of his show and went to bed (couldn’t stay up any longer) and I don’t know how much longer the show went on.<\/p>\r\n<p>The show’s amazing and donates a bunch of money to the charity, but there are a lot of flaws in its execution, and that’s what this article is about.<\/p>\r\n<h1>General Implementation Flaws<\/h1>\r\n<p>Here are some of the general purpose issues with the implementation of the concert.<\/p>\r\n<h2>General Seating<\/h2>\r\n<p>For some bizarre reason, the concert promotors decided to setup this event as general seating. What this means is that if you buy a ticket to the show, there’s no guarantee you’ll have someplace to sit. Yep, first come, first served and it’s a freaking nightmare.<\/p>\r\n<p>See, they sell out the show, so there’s multiple thousands of people there trying to find a place to sit. Now, if you want to stand for 8 hours or so, this isn’t a problem as you can come in and go right to the floor and stand in front of the stage all night listening to the bands. I’m an old guy, so I can no longer stand for hours at a time, so that option isn’t good for me.<\/p>\r\n<p>So what happens, for those that aren’t content to stand on the floor (like me), is that most people get there early and stake out a place to sit in the stands. This isn’t that big of a deal except that when people stake out their seats, people generally leave one seat open on either side of them. Right? You don’t want to be crushed up against someone else all night (and it is a loooong night), so when you mark your seats, you make sure there’s space between you and the couple or group next to you. The problem with this is that since this is a sold out show, there are a LOT of people looking for seats. With the extra seats being open, what this means is that for every group of two people, three seats are consumed. Do the math, that means that a full 33% of the seats are sitting empty, but, don’t forget that it’s a sold out show. It’s a freaking nightmare.<\/p>\r\n<p>Unless you’re a party of one, there’s no way you’re finding two seats open anywhere within the arena. If you’re two or more people, which most are, the only way you’re getting a seat is if you get there reeeeeally early or if you are willing to cajole and push people into shifting around in a particular row to open up enough seats for you. Did I mention it’s a freaking nightmare?<\/p>\r\n<p>They could sell assigned seats and fix this entire problem, but every year there are hundreds or potentially thousands of folks wandering through the arena looking for a place to sit.<\/p>\r\n<h2>VIP Tickets<\/h2>\r\n<p>Now, when I first attended the show, there was an option to purchase VIP tickets at a slightly increased cost. I don’t remember how much it was, but it wasn’t that much, and it made it much easier to attend the show. With VIP tickets, there’s a dedicated area on the floor where you can stand. It’s off to the right, so you’re not near the middle of the stage, but you can still see and hear everything well. With the VIP standing area, it’s easier to come and go and still have a good view. I would argue that regular seats are actually better since you’re closer to the middle of the stage, but if you want to be close, you can’t get very close with regular tickets.<\/p>\r\n<p>Another benefit of the VIP ticket is VIP Seating – the arena marks off a couple of sections for VIP ticket holders, and it’s easier to move between the seats and the floor. Not much easier as the same seating problem that applies to the general ticket holders apply to VIP ticket holders. 33% of the seats are empty between the groups.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, this was a great option the first year we attended the show, but the very next year they increased the VIP ticket price by about 6 times. Were it was a reasonable bump to get VIP tickets my first year, the next year it was hundreds of dollars more (I think it was about $300 more), so really not worth it.<\/p>\r\n<h1>What Went Ghastly Wrong this year<\/h1>\r\n<p>So, with that background in mind, what could have been so horrible about this year’s show to warrant this article. Let me count the ways…<\/p>\r\n<h2>Joe Bonamassa No-show<\/h2>\r\n<p>We decided after that first year that we would only go again if we had VIP tickets (it was too much of a better experience to pass on) but with the $300 increase, we just could never justify the expense. I watch my inbox every year hoping the lineup will make it worth the extra expense and this year they delivered. The announcement came, and there it was… Joe Bonamassa. My wife and I have been wanting to see him in concert, but there he was on the bill for Xmas Jam 2015 (#27 I think it was), and here was our chance. The show was supposed to include the Warren Haynes Band and the Tedeschi Trucks Band. With Joe included, there was a good chance three of the top 100 guitarists in the world would be on the stage at the same time. This was not to be missed.<\/p>\r\n<p>I called my wife, told her the news and asked her if she wanted to go, even with the ENORMOUS price of the VIP tickets, she immediately agreed and I had tickets purchased in seconds then reserved a hotel room and arranged for my sister to take the kids for the weekend. We were all set.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now, normally, the event adds additional bands as it gets closer to the show. So, I’d check back every so often to see what other bands would be there. Less than a week before the show, I checked the site only to learn that Joe Bonamassa wasn’t going to attend the show. Apparently he couldn’t make it.<\/p>\r\n<p>I understand that schedules change and, as this is a benefit concert and NOBODY gets paid, that there’s a chance someone would cancel. The problem for us is that we ONLY bought tickets this year because of Joe Bonamassa and no other reason. The other issue is that they dropped him off the schedule without letting ticket holders know. You’d think in this modern time and with how much we use email to communicate that they would have considered emailing ticket holders to let them know of the change. Nope, nothing. If I’d not checked the schedule on the web site, there’s no way I could have known until I showed up for the show.<\/p>\r\n<p>I’m pretty sure they had advance notice of his cancellation because none of the shirts have his name on them. I can only imagine that when you’re printing (I’m guessing here) 10,000 shirts, that you need quite a bit of lead time, and somehow the shirts miraculously didn’t have Joe’s name on them. So, I imagine the promotors sat on the information for a while before telling us while still letting the shirt people know. Sigh. Big failure here.<\/p>\r\n<h2>VIP Concert Shirts<\/h2>\r\n<p>As part of the VIP experience, they included a free concert shirt with VIP tickets. That’s a nice touch and saved me from having to buy one at the show (which I know I would). A few weeks before the show, they emailed VIP ticket holders (see, I knew they could email us and let us know about Joe not coming, but they apparently decided not to) and asked us to let them know what sizes we needed. I quickly responded and told them my sizes (for me and my wife) and expected to get what I ordered when I arrived at the show.<\/p>\r\n<p>When I arrived at the VIP check-in, I learned that even though they asked for sizes and I provided them ours, they didn’t do anything with the information. Enough people didn’t reply that they just gave people whatever shirts they wanted when they showed up. I had to pick up my kids at school before heading across state to the show, so we got there late in the process, and didn’t get the shirts we ordered.<\/p>\r\n<p>What they should have done is set aside the shirts for the people who requested specific sizes then distribute the remainder to the folks who didn’t. All they had when we arrived were XXL shirts, so my wife and I both got XXL shirts. Now, I can wear an XXL shirt, but that’s way, way too big for my wife. The extra money we paid for VIP tickets? Got my wife a shirt that was too big.<\/p>\r\n<h2>VIP Entrance<\/h2>\r\n<p>One of the things they promoted to VIP ticket holders was a special VIP entrance we could use to expedite access to the venue. Too bad they never told us where to find this entrance nor did they let the people managing the main line know; we asked several employees where it was only to get the information from a guest instead.<\/p>\r\n<p>Clear communication problem; big failure here.<\/p>\r\n<h2>VIP Lounge<\/h2>\r\n<p>Another the thing promoted to VIP ticket holders was a special VIP lounge we could use at the show. Too bad they never told us where to find this entrance nor did they let the ushers know; we asked several employees where it was only to get the information from a guest instead.<\/p>\r\n<p>Clear communication problem; big failure here.<\/p>\r\n<h2>VIP seating vs. Friends and Family Seating<\/h2>\r\n<p>Remember how I told you about this special VIP seating area? It’s on either side of the stage. What I didn’t notice until this year is that the VIP seats are almost the worst seats in the arena (except for those seats behind the stage). From the VIP seats, all you can see is the side of the stage. The stage is open, so you can ‘see’ everything, but only the side of the performers. The better seats? Oh, those are the Friends and Family seats. Apparently if you’re a friend of Warren’s or of the bands, you get better seats than the folks who paid hundreds of dollars for a ticket. Big failure here.<\/p>\r\n<h2>BlackBerry Smoke Letdown<\/h2>\r\n<p>I’m a fan of BlackBerry Smoke, and I was excited to hear they would be performing at the show. Unfortunately, they came on late in the evening (10 PM or 11PM? I can’t remember) right after the Tedeschi Trucks Band (TTB). TTB NAILED IT – they delivered a performance with great gusto and energy. Even though BlackBerry Smoke has songs with some great energy, for some bizarre reason they decided to deliver a set with their slowest and lowest energy songs. So, after getting all fired up and full of energy by the TTB performance, the whole arena almost fell asleep during the BlackBerry Smoke performance.<\/p>\r\n<p>Note to BlackBerry Smoke: when performing at an all-night show, make sure you don’t put your audience to sleep.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Warren’s Attitude<\/h2>\r\n<p>Warren’s awesome. He delivers most performances with a smile and a neighborly attitude. Something must have been wrong with him this year, because he hardly said anything and didn’t have any energy when performing. He came out to play with several bands, but he didn’t look like he wanted to or enjoyed it; he seemed bored or disconnected. He was not a very gracious host.<\/p>\r\n<h1>The Value of the VIP Ticket<\/h1>\r\n<p>The VIP ticket is…cool, but not worth the money. For $300 more per ticket we got the following:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Access to a VIP-only Jam the night before (OK, this was way cool).<\/li>\r\n<li>A pair of Xmas Jam socks (who cares).<\/li>\r\n<li>A cool Xmas Jam poster (unfortunately, I’m 53 and no longer hang rock posters on my bedroom wall).<\/li>\r\n<li>A concert shirt in the wrong size.<\/li>\r\n<li>VIP entrance (OK, but hard to find).<\/li>\r\n<li>VIP Lounge (OK, but not enough seats and the food was crappy).<\/li>\r\n<li>VIP seating (good, but Friends and Family had much better seats; what’s up with that?).<\/li>\r\n<li>VIP Standing Area (good, but for $300, don’t you think we could be center stage?).<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>Overall, we love the event and enjoyed hanging out in Asheville. We’re definitely coming again next year, but I doubt we’ll do the VIP tickets since it’s just not worth $300 more. We’ll be unhappy to miss the VIP concert, because that was a lot of fun, but I can save 75% of the ticket cost by not getting VIP tickets.<\/p>\r\n<p>I hope someone assesses what they’re doing and works to make future events better.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2016-02-15 19:28:24","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2022-12-04 00:56:47","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2016-02-15 19:28:24","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"3","ordering":"37","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"7592","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"446","asset_id":"587","title":"Configuring a Node\/Express Environment on the Raspberry Pi","alias":"configuring-a-node-express-environment-on-the-raspberry-pi","introtext":"<p>As I posted last week, I&rsquo;m working on a project on the Raspberry Pi. As I&rsquo;m not a Python developer, I thought I&rsquo;d write my server code using Node. My previous post was about how I configured my WebStorm instance so I could code my JavaScript on my PC and publish it on the Raspberry Pi. Once I had that working, I started testing my app on the Pi, and that&rsquo;s when I started running into problems. It took me a little while to figure this one out, so I thought I&rsquo;d write about it here in case others have the same problem.<\/p>\r\n<p>As any hardware developer does, before I started, I made sure my Pi had the latest version of Raspian, the default OS for the Pi. In this case, I grabbed the latest version of Raspian from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.raspberrypi.org\/downloads\/raspbian\/\">https:\/\/www.raspberrypi.org\/downloads\/raspbian\/<\/a>. In this case, it&rsquo;s Raspian Jessie (February 2016) as shown in Figure 1.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/pi-node-express-1_640.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1 &ndash; Raspian Download Page<\/p>\r\n<p>I burned the OS to a memory card, inserted it in the device and booted it up. After it booted, I opened a terminal window and checked the node version. Raspian Jessie ships with Node 0.10, which is pretty old. So, before I went any further, I knew I had to update my Node installation. I checked and npm wasn&rsquo;t installed as well, so I had to do that installation as well.<\/p>\r\n<p>Fortunately, the folks at Adafruit published some instructions on how to upgrade node on the Pi; you can find the instructions here: <a href=\"https:\/\/learn.adafruit.com\/node-embedded-development\/installing-node-dot-js\">https:\/\/learn.adafruit.com\/node-embedded-development\/installing-node-dot-js<\/a>. Basically, all you have to do is execute the following commands in a terminal window to update node:<\/p>\r\n<p><code><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">curl -sLS https:\/\/apt.adafruit.com\/add | sudo bash<\/span><\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">sudo apt-get install node<\/span><\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>When you&rsquo;re done, execute the following command to check the version:<\/p>\r\n<p><code><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">node -v<\/span><\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>It should return something like v0.12.0 or greater. OK, at this point, I know I&rsquo;m running a newer version of Node than came with the latest version of Raspian.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now, I knew that interacting with the Pi&rsquo;s GPIO ports was a little different, so I knew I&rsquo;d need a library to make this easier in Node. One of the articles I found mentioned a library called rpi-gpio (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/rpi-gpio\">https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/rpi-gpio<\/a>), so I thought I&rsquo;d give it a try.<\/p>\r\n<p>I opened a terminal window and tried to install rpi-gpoi using the following command:<\/p>\r\n<p><code><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">npm install rpi-gpio --save<\/span><\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, the installation failed every time I tried to install it.

There wasn&rsquo;t an immediate solution provided, but one helpful (sarcasm) visitor suggested looking at the readme at <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/JamesBarwell\/rpi-gpio.js\/blob\/master\/README.md#dependency\">https:\/\/github.com\/JamesBarwell\/rpi-gpio.js\/blob\/master\/README.md#dependency<\/a>. Apparently the version of gcc is a problem with Raspian.<\/p>\r\n<p>I quickly took a look, and the version I was running was much, much different than rpi-gpio expected.

On a hunch, I restarted the Pi and suddenly it worked, the rpi-gpio module installed successfully and I was all ready to go (at least until the next problem pops up).<\/p>\r\n<p>I just have one question for you: why does everything have to be so hard?<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"41","created":"2016-02-16 01:29:45","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2016-02-16 01:29:45","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2016-02-16 01:29:45","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"1","ordering":"26","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"7985","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"447","asset_id":"588","title":"Particle Photon Function Not Found","alias":"particle-photon-function-not-found","introtext":"<p>Lately, I&rsquo;ve been working on a project using the Particle Photon. The project&rsquo;s been &lsquo;done&rsquo; for some time now; the code&rsquo;s all written and the hardware is all soldered together. I&rsquo;m ready to install it, but, of course, I&rsquo;ve found some additional functionality I want to add to the associated Android app. So, I added a couple of additional functions to the Photon&rsquo;s code and started testing them using the Chrome Advanced Rest Client.<\/p>\r\n<p>During my testing, I encountered the following error:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><code><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Function myverylongfunction name not found<\/span><\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>Of course, I studied my Particle C code for a while looking for the problem to no avail. I could not find the problem.<\/p>\r\n<p>I have three functions in my app, so I thought for some reason the Photon was limited in how many functions you could have (turns out the limit is 4<del datetime=\"2016-02-19T12:36:17\">10<\/del>). To test this theory, I reordered the functions to see if the one I was having trouble with would work if it was higher in the list. Nope, that wasn&rsquo;t it.<\/p>\r\n<p>I noticed that the function that wasn&rsquo;t working had a name longer than the rest, so I shortened it and suddenly it started working. If you encounter this issue, know that the maximum function name length is 12 characters. What I don't understand is why this is even an error I had to figure out. The Particle Cloud is parsing the request and looking for a function that matches the name I've provided on the URL. If the functiion name is longer than 12 characters, then tell me that I've passed a function name that's too long. Don't tell me you can't find the function. I knew I was providing the right function name, the one that matched my code, but the Particle Cloud couldn't recognize it because it's too long - that's the perfect time for an error message back from the service that reads something like \"The function name is too long.\" That, for sure, would have shortened my troubleshooting time.<\/p>\r\n<p>You can find the complete documentation here: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.particle.io\/reference\/firmware\/photon\">https:\/\/docs.particle.io\/reference\/firmware\/photon<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>Post Script:<\/p>\r\n<p>OK, so I learned a few things since posting this. I submitted part of this article to the community forums and got a bunch of responses. Several people who responded seemed to think that it was a good idea to fix this. Unfortunately, many other folks had a pretty antagonistic attitude about this; apparently they think this is pretty clearly documented and there&rsquo;s no reason to make this idiot (me) proof. So, if you&rsquo;re just getting started, recognize that the Particle Community doesn&rsquo;t care to catch some errors you may have missed.<\/p>\r\n<p>The documentation at the link I provided above says the following:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Currently, up to 10 cloud variables may be defined and each variable name is limited to a maximum of 12 characters.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, for cloud variables, there can be no more than 10. My bad, I thought that applied to functions; for functions, the limit is 4:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Currently the application supports the creation of up to 4 different cloud functions.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">In order to register a cloud function, the user provides the funcKey, which is the string name used to make a POST request and a funcName, which is the actual name of the function that gets called in your app. The cloud function can return any integer; -1 is commonly used for a failed function call.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The length of the funcKey is limited to a max of 12 characters. If you declare a function name longer than 12 characters the function will not be registered.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, keep in mind that you can only have four functions, and, if any of the function names are too long, they won&rsquo;t even get registered. So, the function not found error? While not useful, it&rsquo;s at least technically accurate &ndash; since my function name was too long, it didn&rsquo;t get truncated, it was simply never registered.<\/p>\r\n<p>It was my understanding that the functions were registered somehow with the cloud, so the cloud understood what is exposed by the device and could act upon the requests coming through. Apparently when you use a function name that&rsquo;s too long, the device never even attempts to register it with the cloud. That&rsquo;s why the server returns function not found, it&rsquo;s because the function doesn&rsquo;t even exist as far as it&rsquo;s concerned and it doesn&rsquo;t know what else to do.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now, I suggested to the Particle community that the cloud could tell that the name was too long and not even try to look for it, instead returning a useful error message that the function name was too long. That suggestion was shot down by a varying degree of &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not understanding&rdquo; or &ldquo;why would we want to deal with something the developer should have done better&rdquo; attitude from the community, so don&rsquo;t expect this to ever be fixed by them. Interesting attitude for a hacker community.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"41","created":"2016-02-18 01:16:46","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2016-02-19 17:37:39","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2016-02-18 01:16:46","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"5","ordering":"24","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"8205","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

Wargo &amp; August M. Wargo<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>August:<\/strong> My dad and I had an idea that our last pinewood derby car should be really cool. My dad is a geek and really good with electronics so he did most of the coding. I did most of the design. I thought that it was a lot of fun because I got to spend more time with my dad and got to do a lot of things that I like. I couldn&rsquo;t wait until the race to see how fast it was. It did not win a single race. But we did win the most unique car design. It was the best Cub Scout experience I've ever had.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>John:<\/strong> My son is in Cub Scouts and for years we've been building Boy Scouts of America Pinewood Derby (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.pinewoodderby.org\">www.pinewoodderby.org<\/a>) cars with the rest of the pack. I've always invited my son's Den into my workshop so the other scouts and their Dads can make use of my tools to build their cars. The Boy Scouts has a policy against Cub Scouts using power tools, but with the right guidance we've gotten along.<\/p>\r\n<p>It's always&hellip;interesting to see how much involvement the Scouts have vs. their parents in making the cars. For the most part, I've let my son do what he wants with his car; I've guided him, but let him cut the car, sand it, paint it and so on. I really only got directly involved when it came to putting the wheels on as he didn't, until recently, have the physical strength and control needed to do that right.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/arduino-pinewood-derby-01.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1 &ndash; A Boy and His Arduino Powered Pinewood Derby Car<\/p>\r\n<p>After watching one particular parent last year spend two hours or more in the shop painstakingly cutting, shaping, sanding and grinding the car into a particular shape, my son and I decided that we'd kick it up a notch this year. Even though I have a pretty nice wood shop, I'm more of a programmer type (I've written 6 books on mobile development), so I suggested that we do something with a programmable microcontroller and some LEDs for this year's race. I'd wanted to do something with Arduino, so this seemed like the perfect opportunity to do so while at the same time providing me with a chance to teach my son how to wire things together, solder and write code.<\/p>\r\n<p>In this project, we'll show you how to create an Arduino-powered Pinewood Derby car. We'll be using an Arduino (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.arduino.cc\">www.arduino.cc<\/a>) microcontroller board, some LEDs and an accelerometer to flash a set of LEDs depending on the orientation of the car.<\/p>\r\n<p>For our first iteration of this, we configured the car so that when it sits in the pits, it will flash the lights in a certain pattern. When the car is at the starting gate, and when it's on the angled portion of the track, the light pattern changes and becomes much more active. Knowing that the car may jump off the track, we also added special added patterns for when the car is sitting on its left or right side. Since everything is done in code, it's super easy to completely change the light patterns and orientation settings in the software. You and your son can spend hours trying out different patterns to get the right, and potentially unique, ones for your car.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n","fulltext":"\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h1>Source Code<\/h1>\r\n<p>The project's Arduino source code available at <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/Arduino-Pinewood-Derby.\">https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/Arduino-Pinewood-Derby.<\/a><\/p>\r\n<h1>Materials<\/h1>\r\n<p>The project uses the following materials:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Official Pinewood Derby car kit (2 or more: if you're like me, you'll make mistakes and need to start over).

As its open-source, there are a lot of different versions of the board available. The Arduino team has designed some boards and different parts of the community have implemented their own designs. If you look on Maker Shed (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.makershed.com\/collections\/arduino-boards\">www.makershed.com\/collections\/arduino-boards<\/a>) you'll find a bevy of devices available of all sizes and capabilities.<\/p>\r\n<p>You can use whatever Arduino compatible board you want, but since the Pinewood Derby car has specific requirements (confined by specific minimum and maximum length and width requirements as well as a weight limit), your choices will be limited based on what will actually fit on (or in) the car.<\/p>\r\n<p>To prove that we could create the thing we wanted, we initially prototyped the solution using a breadboard and the Arduino Micro (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.makershed.com\/products\/arduino-micro\">www.makershed.com\/products\/arduino-micro<\/a>). This allowed me to teach my son breadboarding and gave me a chance to get him involved in wiring the solution before we started soldering things together.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Arduino Micro turned out to be too big for the project when you take into consideration all of the other components we needed to mount on the car as well. So I looked around for a smaller board we could use. I selected the Arduino Teensy (www.pjrc.com\/teensy) because it was small enough and had all of the connections we needed. For this project, I used a Teensy 3.0; I purchased the board about a year ago. Since then, a newer version of the board was released and I'm sure there are other, suitably sized alternatives you can select for your version of this project. The Lithium Ion battery I used output 3.7 Volts, so I had to make sure the board I selected could operate on less than 5V.<\/p>\r\n<p>For this project as configured, you'll need a board with minimum of 10 digital outputs and three analog inputs on whatever board you select.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Power<\/h2>\r\n<p>When we first started working on this project, I thought we'd power the car with one or more traditional alkaline batteries. We wired a battery pack into our solution and it worked great. As we started to figure out how everything would fit on\/in the car and when we thought about the car's weight limitation, it quickly became clear that this wasn't an optimal solution. My son's a smartphone fanatic (even though he's too young to actually have a smartphone), so I started thinking about using a smartphone battery for this thing. A quick search pointed me to Adafruit's 3.7v 1200mAh Lithium Ion Polymer Battery (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/258\">www.adafruit.com\/products\/258<\/a>). It has enough juice to power the Arduino and LEDs plus run the car for several hours.<\/p>\r\n<p>There are smaller (and bigger) batteries available, but for Pinewood Derby cars, it's important to keep in mind that for the best performing car you want the car's weight to be as close to the weight limit (5 ounces) as possible. With this battery and the other parts I selected, the car's total weight was 4.8 ounces, so we needed to add very little weight to the car to bring its weight up to the limit. If you select a smaller battery, keep in mind that you'll need to add weight if you want the car to perform as well.<\/p>\r\n<p>My original plan was to disconnect the battery to charge it using an external charging module. My son and I started thinking of how cool it would be to have the car itself be rechargeable so we decided on the Adafruit USB LiIon\/LiPoly charging module (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/259\">www.adafruit.com\/products\/259<\/a>). With the battery embedded in the bottom of the car and the charging module mounted on the back, you can charge the car using a standard cell phone charger. The charging module uses a USB Mini-B connector (rather than the modern Micro USB connector), so I had to dig out an older BlackBerry charger to use to charge the car.<\/p>\r\n<p>Adafruit now has an even smaller charging module available (www.adafruit.com\/products\/1904) that uses a Micro USB connector, so this may be a better choice for your project. It looks to be the same size as the power switch (described in the next section), so it would be really easy to stack them together and take up very little space on the back of the car.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you don't want to go the rechargeable route for this project, you could easily use the Maker Shed 9V Battery Case for Arduino (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.makershed.com\/products\/9v-battery-case-for-arduino\">www.makershed.com\/products\/9v-battery-case-for-arduino<\/a>). It should fit within the base of the car (although you'll have to make a taller car) and has a built-in power switch.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Power Switch<\/h2>\r\n<p>With power sorted out, it's time to think about how to turn the car on and off. In my original alkaline battery design, I expected that I'd use something like the Adafruit Breadboard-friendly SPDT Slide Switch (www.adafruit.com\/product\/805). Instead I selected the Push-button Power Switch Breakout (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/1400\">www.adafruit.com\/products\/1400<\/a>). It has mounting holes, so I knew I could easily mount it on the car, and it's got an LED indicator underneath so it's easy to tell whether the car is powered or not (just in case something else isn't working) and the red glow just looks cool. The switch is a toggle switch, push it once to turn the device on and push it again to turn it off.<\/p>\r\n<p>You can use something like the Maker Shed Tactile On\/Off Switch with Leads (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.makershed.com\/products\/tactile-on-off-switch\">www.makershed.com\/products\/tactile-on-off-switch<\/a>) but it doesn't have an indicator light and you would have to have to figure out a way to mount the device on\/in the car.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Accelerometer<\/h2>\r\n<p>To allow the Arduino to measure the car's orientation, I selected the Adafruit ADXL335 5V ready triple-axis accelerometer (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/163\">www.adafruit.com\/products\/163<\/a>). Even though it's rated at 5V, it will operate at the voltages provided by the battery I selected. It has a small form factor and easily mounts on the front of the car.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Lighting<\/h2>\r\n<p>We had a lot of options for implementing the lighting for the car. In the prototype we made, we simply wired in 5 white LEDs, but we were looking for something more. I was looking for something a little more professional looking than some hand-wired LEDs, so I tried the Adafruit 8 LED NeoPixel Stick (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/1426\">www.adafruit.com\/products\/1426<\/a>). If you're looking for something simple that will mount cleanly on the car, this is a good option as everything is already connected together and only uses only a few wires. It's also multi-colored, so that's pretty cool. It wasn't bright enough for our purposes and I had some issues getting the sample code to work correctly, so I discarded it as an option.<\/p>\r\n<p>Instead we decided to just wire up 10 LED bulbs and I'll show you how we did that later. To do this, I purchased three sets of 3.7V LEDs, blue, yellow and orange; yellow and blue to match the Cub Scouts colors and orange&nbsp; simply because my son and I both like orange. I selected clear LEDs so that the LEDs all looked the same until they illuminate. You'll also need the appropriate resistors to use with the LEDs you select. For this project, I purchased LED\/Resistor bundles from Amazon.com (blue: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"amzn.com\/B004UZCADG\">amzn.com\/B004UZCADG<\/a>, yellow: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"amzn.com\/B004UZB9WO\">amzn.com\/B004UZB9WO<\/a> &amp; orange: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"amzn.com\/B004UZ3FNU\">amzn.com\/B004UZ3FNU<\/a>).<\/p>\r\n<h2>Wiring<\/h2>\r\n<p>To connect the LEDs to the Arduino board, I purchased some ribbon cable; since I was connecting 10 lights, this ribbon cable was perfect <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sparkfun.com\/products\/10647.\">https:\/\/www.sparkfun.com\/products\/10647.<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p>The battery connected directly to the charging module, but I also needed to connect the charging module to the switch and from there to the Arduino board so I needed black and red connecting wire.<\/p>\r\n<h1>Making the Car<\/h1>\r\n<p>When it comes to creating the car, you can pretty much make it any way you want. The Scouts are supposed to make the car themselves (with your help, of course) so what you'll need to do is take a look at the components you'll be wiring together and build the car that can accommodate the configuration and layout you implement. This takes careful planning as your car design and electronics implementation are closely connected; you'll have to plan both in parallel.<\/p>\r\n<p>Note: Be sure to check your Pack's Pinewood Derby race rules to make sure the car you create complies with them. Our pack for example has specific rules for width, height and weight plus we had to ensure that the rule about components being solidly mounted on the car were followed.<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2 shows the car we created. In our implementation, the battery is underneath the car and all of the rest of the electronics are mounted to the top of the car as shown in the figure. You don't have to do it this way, we just selected this approach as it highlighted the electronics and that was what we were leading with; it was important that our car looked like it had a bunch of hardware on it.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/arduino-pinewood-derby-02.png\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2 &ndash; Arduino Powered Pinewood Derby Car<\/p>\r\n<p>For your car, you may want to hide everything or only some components. You could for example, carve out a cavity for all of the components and only show the charging connector and the LEDs. For our race, I was concerned that someone would complain about potential cheating if anything was hidden, so I made sure that everything (except for the wires connecting the battery to the charging module) were easily visible. If any complaint was made, I could simply unscrew a few screws (12 total) and the whole thing would come off and could be easily inspected before being reattached to the car for a race.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Battery Cavity<\/h2>\r\n<p>Before you make any profile cuts to the car, you need to first make a space for the battery underneath the body of the car. Do this now so that the car's top can rest flat against your work surface as you complete these steps. If you make other cuts to the car's body before performing this step, you may find the car body rocking or slipping around as you cut the battery cavity.<\/p>\r\n<p>To start, lay the car body on its top so that the axle slots are facing up. In the official Pinewood Derby kit, the car's rear axle slot is closer to the back of the car than the front axle slot is to the front of the car. As you work with the car, keep this in mind. Many cars are made backwards, with the car facing the wrong way &ndash; the front wheels using the rear axle slots.<\/p>\r\n<p>With the car in this position, figure out where you want to put the battery. Conventional wisdom, feel free to disagree, is that you want the car's center of gravity to be right in front of the rear wheels. Select a position for the battery that makes the most sense for you and your car. Keep in mind that we'll soon be screwing electronic components to the car body, so you will want to make sure that the battery is placed in a position where you can minimize the chance that the screws will pierce the battery. For our car, we put the battery right in front of the rear axle.<\/p>\r\n<p>With the battery held against the bottom of the car, mark the battery's position by either placing marks at each corner or tracing the battery profile with a pencil. Remove the battery and use a ruler or some sort of straight-edge to mark the complete battery cavity. Be sure to leave a little extra space around the battery as we'll be using epoxy later to cement the battery in place and it will need some room to purchase. Be sure to also leave a little room at the top of the battery for the power cable. Figure 1 shows the results of this step on our car. The X in the figure marks the area of the car body that will be chiseled out.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/arduino-pinewood-derby-03.png\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 3 &ndash; Marking the Battery Position<\/p>\r\n<p>Using an X-Acto knife or other hobby knife, trace the edges of the battery compartment you just marked. Make multiple passes and cut down to the approximate height of the battery.<\/p>\r\n<p>Using a chisel, cut away the wood within the cavity lines to the thickness of the battery as shown in Figure 4. When chiseling out the material, do as much of your carving away from the rear axle. When you carve toward the axle, you run the risk of cutting underneath the material between the battery cavity and the rear axle, popping off a chunk of wood between the two. If this happens, there won't be solid wood in place to hold the axle in place, so the car body will be ruined.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/arduino-pinewood-derby-04.png\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 4 &ndash; Finished Battery Cavity<\/p>\r\n<p>When finished, sand the cavity to smooth out any remaining rough spots. Place the battery in the finished cavity to make sure it fits and that it's flush with the bottom of the car.<\/p>\r\n<p>With the battery in place, mark the location of the battery wires then remove the battery. Our battery came with a connector at the end, so we cut that off so that we'd have two unfinished wires coming out of the battery. This is probably not that important, but be sure to cut each wire separately to avoid shorting out the battery while you cut it.<\/p>\r\n<p>Drill a small hole (big enough to feed the battery wires through) in the bottom of the car where you marked the battery wire location. This hole will be used to route the battery wires to the top of the car where the other components will be mounted. Make sure the hole is small enough for just the battery wires and that it goes straight through to where the other components will be.<\/p>\r\n<p>When finished, you should be able to feed the wires through to the top of the car and insert the battery flush within the battery cavity.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Cutting the Car's Profile<\/h2>\r\n<p>For this car, we cut the body into the traditional Pinewood Derby wedge profile. May car kits already come in this profile, so it's a pretty popular design for many Cub Scouts, all they need to do is paint it, put on the wheels and they're ready to go. Here we had to make a slight adjustment to the thickness of the wedge in order to accommodate the 1\/2 inch screws we used to attach the components to the car.<\/p>\r\n<p>Using a pencil, mark the side of the car with the wedge design, making sure that the car's thickness doesn't fall below 1\/2 inch at the front of the car as shown in Figure 5. In the figure, the back of the car is to the left of the image. To make this easy, I marked the front of the car at 1\/2 in and drew a line to an arbitrary point on the back of the car, enough space to accommodate the battery height and length of the mounting screws.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/arduino-pinewood-derby-05.png\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 5 &ndash; Marking the Wedge<\/p>\r\n<p>Note: when it comes to cutting the car's body, use caution when making the cut. I do not recommend you allow your son to make the cut &ndash; you should make it using the appropriate safety precautions and necessary safety gear. I let my son cut his Pinewood Derby car on the band saw, but only under my direct supervision. Whether or not you let your son use power tools is up to you (not me).<\/p>\r\n<p>Cut the car on the band saw using the line drawn on the car's side. Be sure to wear safety glasses. Next, use a bench sander to smooth out any roughness in the cut and flatten the car's top.<\/p>\r\n<p>We knew that there was going to be some wires routed across the top of car (connecting the different components), so we cut a trough in the top of the car about 3\/8 inch wide and about 1\/4 inch deep. I used my table saw for this, but you could easily do this with a Dremel or Router.<\/p>\r\n<p>Using the saw, I set the blade's height to the cut depth I wanted and positioned the saw's fence to position my first cut right down the middle of the car. After running the car across the saw for the first cut, I moved the fence away from the blade by about a blade width and ran the car across the blade two more times (flipping the car around between cuts). This gave me two more cuts, one on either side of the original one. I repeated this process until I had a trough cut that matched the width I needed. I could also have made this cut in a single pass using a dado blade, but it was more fun to do it this way and taught my son a few things about the table saw.<\/p>\r\n<p>One of the things we didn't do, but you should, is round out the front of the car to make it more aerodynamic going down the track (and cooler looking too). Be careful to not shorten the car by cutting material off the front of the car, your Pack's rules may not allow it.<\/p>\r\n<p>At this point, the car body is ready; sand and smooth the remaining edges as needed then paint the car and put it aside to dry.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Wheels<\/h2>\r\n<p>Over the years, I've always made my son put the wheels on his car at the last minute, right before we headed to the race. I did this because I know that wheel placement is critical to car performance, and if I put the wheels on too early, my son would play with the car and whack the wheels out of alignment, ruining the car's chances in the race.<\/p>\r\n<p>When we built this car, the same rule applied and the night before the race we were putting the wheels on and struggling. We needed to manhandle the axles into the car and I quickly noticed a problem I created when we added the electronics to the body. In order to be able to insert the wheels, you have to hold the car pretty tight while doing so. Electronic components can be fragile, and I was worried that I might smash something or break a connection if I held the car too tight while putting on the wheels. I had a tough time with the wheels and axles simply because I was afraid of holing the car too tight while putting them in.<\/p>\r\n<p>I learned that in this case, it made sense to put the wheels on early, before mounting all of the electronic hardware on top of the car. That way I could hold the car as hard as I wanted as I worked.<\/p>\r\n<p>But how to protect the wheels after they're on the car? I came up with an excellent solution (one I wish I had come up with years ago). When you pick up your son's car kit, pick up a couple of extra ones. You're going to make a mistake, so be sure to have a couple of extra ones on hand just in case. Once the wheels are on, though, take an extra car body blank and keep it under the car (you can see an example of this if you look closely at Figure 2) at all times. It's the exact same size as the car you're working with and it's flat on top and bottom. You can even tack small pieces of wood on the front and back of the blank to keep the production car on place on top of the block.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Connecting the Electronic Components<\/h2>\r\n<p>Now that you have a car design, it's time to start assembling the electronic components. Figure 6 shows a high-level illustration of how everything wires together. I've labeled the figures with numbers indicating the different steps in the connection process. The figure shows a logical connection diagram, how each individual component connects to its peers. In reality, part of the wiring for steps 4 and 5 are combined together in order to simplify the wiring.<\/p>\r\n<p>Note: Then making connections between the components, be sure to use the appropriate length wires to enable the particular layout you have selected for your vehicle. You don't have a lot of space to work with on\/in the car, so things will likely be a little tight. As I soldered things together, I tried to use the shortest possible wires in order to minimize any chaos on top of the car.<\/p>\r\n<p>The charging module is smart enough so that you plug a rechargeable battery into it and wire the charging module to the electronic components that need electricity. When the charging module is plugged into a cell phone charger or USB cable, it will charge the battery and pass the appropriate voltage onto the electronic components. When you disconnect the charger, the battery provides voltage to the electronic components.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/arduino-pinewood-derby-06.png\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 6 &ndash; Logical Connection Diagram<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Step 1:<\/strong> Pass the battery wires up through the hole you drilled in the bottom of the car and solder them to the input pins on the charging module. The battery connects to the BATT connectors shown in the top right of Figure 7 (highlighted in a red box in the figure). Solder the battery's red wire to the charging module's + (positive) BATT connector. Solder the battery's black wire to the charging module's &ndash; (negative) BATT connector.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/arduino-pinewood-derby-07.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 7 &ndash; Charging Module (used with permission)<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Step 2:<\/strong> Begin by soldering the pushbutton to the switch module shown in Figure 8. The top and bottom connectors on the pushbutton (left) solder into the top and bottom module connections (right) in the figure.<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/arduino-pinewood-derby-08.jpg\" height=\"365\" width=\"728\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 8 &ndash; Power Switch Module (used with permission)<\/p>\r\n<p>The power switch takes two wires (positive and negative) wired to the input connectors and another two off of the output connectors. The connections are the same on both sides of the module, so for this step, pick one side of the module and make both connections to the same side. Solder a red wire from the charging module's + (positive) LOAD connector (Figure 7) to the switch's In connector. Solder a black wire from the charging module's &ndash; (negative) LOAD connector to the switch's G (ground) connector.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Step 3:<\/strong> The pin layout for the Teensy 3.0 microcontroller is shown in Figure 9 (Image used with permission); for this project, we'll be connecting a bunch of stuff to it.<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/teensy30_front_pinout.png\" height=\"446\" width=\"384\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 9 &ndash; Teensy 3.0 Pin Configuration (Used with Permission)<\/p>\r\n<p>At any point in the process from here, you can secure the battery in the battery cavity on the bottom of the car. You could use a non-permanent approach like duct tape or suitable alternative to hold it in place, but as there might be collisions and the battery could pop out, I decided to take a more permanent approach. For this project, we used Epoxy to cement the battery into the cavity. Make sure the battery is flush with the bottom of the car and that there's a little space between the battery and the car body. For epoxy, I used <a href=\"http:\/\/www.homedepot.com\/p\/Loctite-8-fl-oz-Professional-Job-Size-Epoxy-1365736\/100371835\">http:\/\/www.homedepot.com\/p\/Loctite-8-fl-oz-Professional-Job-Size-Epoxy-1365736\/100371835<\/a> but you could also use something like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.homedepot.com\/p\/Loctite-0-85-fl-oz-Quick-Set-Epoxy-1395391\/100371815.\">http:\/\/www.homedepot.com\/p\/Loctite-0-85-fl-oz-Quick-Set-Epoxy-1395391\/100371815.<\/a> Mix an enough epoxy to fill the gaps between the battery and the car body and spread it over the cavity, covering enough of the battery to hold it in place. Only use enough epoxy to cover the gaps and make a smooth cover flush with the bottom of the car.<\/p>\r\n<p>Note: Keep in mind, that once the battery is epoxied in there, it's not coming out without destroying the car, so plan carefully.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Step 4:<\/strong> At this point, it's time to connect the Accelerometer and the LEDs to the Arduino. Because of the amount of available space on the car, we positioned the accelerometer on the front of the car and the block of LEDs between it and the Arduino board as shown in Figure 2. If you look at Figure 6, you should be able to see that both the Accelerometer and the LED block have one common connection: the (black) ground wire. To simplify the wiring, I decided to use a single ground wire and share it across both devices. To do this, cut a length of black wire long enough to connect from the Arduino GND pin on the middle-right side of the board shown in Figure 9 to the front of the car. Don't worry about making it too long, you can always trim it back later. Strip the insulation off of one end and solder the wire to the Arduino GND pin.<\/p>\r\n<p>Next you'll need to prepare wires to connect the Arduino board to the Accelerometer and to create the block of LEDs.<\/p>\r\n<p>First measure out two lengths of the 10 wire ribbon cable, select a length that will be able to connect from the Arduino board all the way to the front of the car. That's longer than is needed, but you'll trim them back as you wire together the rest of the car.<\/p>\r\n<p>Strip the ends of one of the ribbon cables and solder the wires to pins 0 through 9 on the bottom of the Arduino board shown in Figure 9. These wires will eventually connect to the LED block as shown in Figure 12.<\/p>\r\n<p>Remove most of the wires on the other section of ribbon cable, leaving only 4 wires. I recommend leaving the red wire and three other colors if possible. One of those wires is for providing voltage to the accelerometer and you might as well keep the color convention used so far and use the red wire for that connection.<\/p>\r\n<p>Strip the ends of the 4-wire ribbon cable and solder the red wire to the 3.3V pin shown on the right side of Figure 9. Next, solder the remaining three wires to Arduino pins 14 (A0), 15 (A1) &amp; 16 (A2).<\/p>\r\n<p>At this point, you'll have one black ground wire and two ribbon cables (one 10-wire and a 4-wire cable) connected to the Arduino board. Now we'll need to assemble the block of LEDs. In our design, the lights were mounted right next to the Arduino board and the accelerometer was positioned at the front of the car. So, the 10 wire ribbon cable will connect directly to the LED block while the 4-wire ribbon cable will travel underneath the LED block to the accelerometer at the front of the car. Don't forget too that the LED block and the accelerometer are going to share the ground connection provided by that lone black wire you have connected to the Arduino's ground.<\/p>\r\n<p>To create the LED block, I cut a piece of prototyping board to fit the top of the car body and allow me to fit all 10 LEDs and their associated resistors as shown in Figure 10. I positioned the LEDs on the outside of the board and positioned the resistors in the middle of the board wired into the black ground wire. The ground wire connects the resistors to ground underneath the board while the ribbon cable travels across the top of the board and each wire splits off to connect to the + wire of each LED.<\/p>\r\n<p>Note: I used a block of two-sided tape (shown under the ribbon cable on the left of Figure 10) to hold the ribbon cable in place as I made the connections.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/arduino-pinewood-derby-10.png\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 10 &ndash; Completed LED Block<\/p>\r\n<p>For our car, we used three different color LEDs: blue on the outside, yellow just inside the blue and orange in the middle as shown in Figure 11. There are 4 blue and yellow LEDs and only 2 orange ones. The LEDs are clear so when the car is off, you can't tell what colors are used. You can, of course, use whatever colors and patterns you want for your car.<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/arduino-pinewood-derby-09.png\" height=\"226\" width=\"225\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 11 &ndash; LED Color Placement<\/p>\r\n<p>If you look at Figure 12 you'll see a logical wiring diagram that shows how the different components are connected.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/arduino-pinewood-derby-12.png\" height=\"411\" width=\"446\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 12 &ndash; LED Block Wiring Diagram<\/p>\r\n<p>On the board, each LED's negative lead (shorter wire) is soldered to the nearest resistor lead. Then the other resistor lead is soldered to the ground wire. To make this work cleanly with the one ground wire, I used a knife to strip all of the insulation off the ground wire between the first and last resistors. Where the resistors come through the board, I wrapped the leads from two aligned resistors around the ground wire and soldered them in place. This was the easiest way for me to use a single ground wire for all of the LEDs as well as the accelerometer.<\/p>\r\n<p>Next, I put a piece of double-sided tape on the board and connected the ribbon to it. This allowed me to split off each of the wires and connect each wire to the individual LED + lead (the longer wire) as shown in the two previous figures. Solder the ribbon cable wires to the LEDs using the pattern (pin layout) shown in Figure 12. The pin numbers shown in the figure correspond to the connections shown in Figure 9. If you wire yours differently, you'll have to make some minor changes to the application source code shown later in the article.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Step 5:<\/strong> Now, cut the remaining length of the black ground wire to fit the location of the accelerometer on the car then strip the end and solder the wire to the ground connection (GND) on the accelerometer shown in Figure 13.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/arduino-pinewood-derby-13.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 13 &ndash; Accelerometer Module (used with permission)<\/p>\r\n<p>Cut the 4-wire ribbon cable to length then strip the wire ends and solder them to the accelerometer. Solder the red wire to the voltage input (Vin) connector on the accelerometer. Solder the remaining wires to the Xout, Yout and Zout connectors on the accelerometer shown in the figure. In our configuration, we have the accelerometer's X output to the Arduino pin 14, Y output to pin 15 and Z output to pin 16. If you wire yours differently, you'll have to make some minor changes to the application source code shown later in the article.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Mounting the Hardware<\/h2>\r\n<p>With everything wired up, you could go ahead and mount all of the components to your car body, but then you'll be jinxing things (I never screw a PC case cover on until after I'm certain everything works, otherwise I know I'll just be taking them off again to troubleshoot). In our configuration, we used the #2 screws to mount everything but the Arduino board to the car. Add nylon spacers under components as needed to help ensure there's enough space for wires and the ribbon cable to route between components without pinching.<\/p>\r\n<p>There weren't any mounting holes on the Teensy to use and the ribbon cable pretty much holds the board in place. You could use brads or a small nail to nail the board to the car body, but that didn't seem to be necessary.<br \/>I used epoxy to hold the battery securely in the battery cavity in the bottom of the car. You could use double-sided tape or even duct tape to hold it in place; I went for the permanent solution so I would never have to worry about it falling out in a crash.<\/p>\r\n<h1>Setting Up the Development Environment<\/h1>\r\n<p>In order to program an Arduino board, you need to use the free Arduino IDE. The Teensy board I used for this project requires some extra software, Teensyduino and the Teensy Loader, in order to be able to download applications onto the board. Unfortunately, as I write this, the latest version of the Teensy Loader is not compatible with the latest version of the Arduino IDE; it can only work with Arduino IDE version 1.06. So, point your browser of choice to <a href=\"http:\/\/arduino.cc\/en\/Main\/OldSoftwareReleases\">http:\/\/arduino.cc\/en\/Main\/OldSoftwareReleases<\/a> then download and install Arduino IDE version 1.06.<\/p>\r\n<p>You'll also need to install the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pjrc.com\/teensy\/teensyduino.html\">https:\/\/www.pjrc.com\/teensy\/teensyduino.html<\/a> in order to enable the IDE to see the Teensy board.<\/p>\r\n<p>Next, download and install the latest version of the Teensy Loader from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pjrc.com\/teensy\/loader.html.\">https:\/\/www.pjrc.com\/teensy\/loader.html.<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p>With all of the software installed, open the Arduino IDE. You'll first need to configure the IDE so it knows what board you are working with. Open the tools menu and select the appropriate Teensy board as shown in Figure 14.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/arduino-pinewood-derby-14.png\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 14 &ndash; Configuring the Arduino IDE for the Teensy Board<\/p>\r\n<p>You'll also need to configure the IDE so it knows how to communicate with the board. Open the Tools menu again and make sure USB Type: Serial is selected as shown in Figure 15.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/arduino-pinewood-derby-15.png\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 15 &ndash; Configuring the Arduino IDE Connection Type<\/p>\r\n<p>With the software in place, download this project's code from <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/Arduino-Pinewood-Derby.\">https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/Arduino-Pinewood-Derby.<\/a> Once you have the code, open the Arduino IDE then open the downloaded project file called pinewood1.ino.<br \/>Connect a USB cable from one of the USB ports on your computer system to the Micro USB cable on the Arduino board. If you followed the instructions in this project, you'll actually have two USB ports available to you, one on the charging module and another on the Arduino board. Be sure to plug the USB cable to the one on the Arduino board (shown in Figure 9).<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/arduino-pinewood-derby-16.png\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 16 &ndash; Arduino IDE and Teensy Loader<\/p>\r\n<p>You can compile the application code by clicking the checkmark button in the upper left corner of Figure 16. You can also compile and load the application code onto a connected Arduino board by clicking the right arrow button to the right of the checkmark button.<\/p>\r\n<p>When you do this, the Teensy Loader window will open as shown in the figure. The first time you to this, you'll need to press the small black button on the Teensy Board to reset the board and initialize the loader. Once you've done that, the code should download into the board every time you click the deploy button in the IDE.<\/p>\r\n<p>If everything went well with your assembly, the LEDs should start blinking away. If you wired the LEDs or the accelerometer into different pins, you'll need to change the code before you can run the application. Refer to the next section for a detailed analysis of the application code and what you'll need to change.<\/p>\r\n<h1>The Code<\/h1>\r\n<p>In this section, I'll walk you through portions of the project's Arduino source code. The complete source code for the project can be found at <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/Arduino-Pinewood-Derby.\">https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/Arduino-Pinewood-Derby.<\/a><br \/>The code starts by defining some constants used by the application:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>\/\/Number of lights the car has<\/code><br \/><code>const int numLights = 10;<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/====================================================<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/ Constants used to define the accelerometer input<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/ pins<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/====================================================<\/code><br \/><code>const int xPin = 14;<\/code><br \/><code>const int yPin = 15;<\/code><br \/><code>const int zPin = 16;<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/====================================================<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/ Constants used to identify the device's orientation<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/====================================================<\/code><br \/><code>const int IS_FLAT = 0;<\/code><br \/><code>const int IS_LEFT = 1;<\/code><br \/><code>const int IS_RIGHT = 2;<\/code><br \/><code>const int IS_SLANT = 3;<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/====================================================<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/ Orientation thresholds<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/====================================================<\/code><br \/><code>const int T_RIGHT = 400;<\/code><br \/><code>const int T_LEFT = 525;<\/code><br \/><code>const int T_SLANT = 470;<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>int blueLights[4] = {0,4,5,9};<\/code><br \/><code>int orangeLights[2] = {2,7};<\/code><br \/><code>int yellowLights[4] = {1,3,6,8};<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>int i = 0;<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>The numLights constant is used to manage the process of looping through all of the lights. Whenever the application needs to do something to all of the lights, to turn them all on or all off for example, you'll see something like this:<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>for (i = 0; i &lt; numLights; i++) {<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; \/\/do something here<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>}<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>For my code, I wired the LEDs to the Arduino's digital output pins beginning with pin 0, this is what allows me to easily loop through all of the lights using this code. It's important that the lights are wired sequentially, beginning with pin 0, as shown in Figure 12 in order for this code to work. If you wired the lights to a different starting pin, you'll need to change the affected for loops everywhere so that the loop begins with the first digital output pin you used.<\/p>\r\n<p>In order to make the code more readable, I defined constants for each of the accelerometer inputs:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>\/\/ Constants used to define the accelerometer input<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/ pins<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/====================================================<\/code><br \/><code>const int xPin = 14;<\/code><br \/><code>const int yPin = 15;<\/code><br \/><code>const int zPin = 16;<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>If you connected the accelerometer Xout, Yout or Zout pins differently than is described earlier in this article, you will need to change the values here to align with how your device is wired.<br \/>I defined constants for the different orientations the application will react to:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>\/\/====================================================<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/ Constants used to identify the device's orientation<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/====================================================<\/code><br \/><code>const int IS_FLAT = 0;<\/code><br \/><code>const int IS_LEFT = 1;<\/code><br \/><code>const int IS_RIGHT = 2;<\/code><br \/><code>const int IS_SLANT = 3;<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>This makes the code a little more readable and allowed me to implement a simple switch statement to branch on the different orientations.<\/p>\r\n<p>As I tweaked the car so that the program could react to different orientation thresholds, I defined the threshold values as constants at the beginning of the application so that I wouldn't have to hunt for them when I needed to make changes.<\/p>\r\n<p><code>\/\/====================================================<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/ Orientation thresholds<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/====================================================<\/code><br \/><code>const int T_RIGHT = 400;<\/code><br \/><code>const int T_LEFT = 525;<\/code><br \/><code>const int T_SLANT = 470;<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>Change the values here to affect what accelerometer reading switches the car from flat mode to left, right or slant mode.<\/p>\r\n<p>I also defined arrays for each of the light groupings (blue, yellow and orange) so that the application would have an easy way to affect all lights of the same color simultaneously:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>int blueLights[4] = {0,4,5,9};<\/code><br \/><code>int orangeLights[2] = {2,7};<\/code><br \/><code>int yellowLights[4] = {1,3,6,8};<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>When you look later in the code, you'll see that I made separate functions for affecting each light grouping. I know I could just pass an array to a function and have the function affect all lights defined by the array, but I was trying to keep the code simple for my son and not try to get into array passing (which seems to be challenging to do in Arduino C).<\/p>\r\n<p>With all of the application's constants defined, it's time to jump into the code.<\/p>\r\n<p>The setup function initializes the application and the car's hardware:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>void setup() { &nbsp;<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp; \/\/Set all of the pins to output mode<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; for (i = 0; i &lt; numLights; i++) {<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pinMode(i, OUTPUT);<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; }<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; \/\/make sure all of the lights are off<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; doAll(LOW); <\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; \/\/Grab the initial value off of the accelerometer<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; \/\/this will be disgarded.

These statements instruct the Arduino on how to deal with those 10 pins.<\/p>\r\n<p>Next the application calls a simple function called doAll to make sure that the output voltage for all of the LED pins is LOW (0). I found that the Teensy board automatically turned one of the pins on, so I had to add this call to setup to make sure that the car started with all lights off.<\/p>\r\n<p>Another thing I noticed is that the accelerometer would sometimes start with rogue values for the X, Y and\/or Z axes, so during setup I had the application read all initial values from the accelerometer then discard them. If I didn't do this, the car would often start by displaying one of the light patterns when in reality the car was sitting flat.<\/p>\r\n<p>Just for fun, I then had the code wait for half a second (500 milliseconds) then flash the lights twice to get everyone's attention before doing its light thing.<\/p>\r\n<p>After setup executes, the Arduino will repeatedly execute the loop function. Anything the car needs to do has to be coded here:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>void loop() {<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; \/\/make sure all of the lights are off<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; doAll(LOW);<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; \/\/Read the accelerometer<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; int orientation = getOrientation();<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; \/\/Now do something based on the orientation<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; switch (orientation) {<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; case IS_LEFT: <\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doAllRight(100);<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; break;<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; case IS_RIGHT: <\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doAllLeft(100);<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; break;<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; case IS_FLAT: <\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doCycle(125);<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; break;<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; case IS_SLANT:<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doBlend(75);<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; break;<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; default:<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \/\/This should never execute<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \/\/make sure all of the lights are off<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doAll(LOW);<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; }<\/code><br \/><code>}<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>The function first sets all lights to off, something I probably didn't need to do, but I learned a long time ago never to assume any state within an application. Next, the code reads the accelerometer then fires off a function to blink the lights in a certain pattern depending on the car's orientation. If you want to make your own patterns, simply code the function that implements it and change the loop function so your function (or functions) are called when the car is in a particular orientation.<\/p>\r\n<p>You can also add additional orientations by adding the appropriate constants at the beginning of the code, add the appropriate case statement to the loop function and modify the getOrientation function (described below) so it can determine the orientation you want the car to react to.<\/p>\r\n<p>In the application's getOrientation function, the code reads the accelerometer then uses the different threshold constants to determine the car's current orientation:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>&nbsp; int getOrientation(){<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; int x = analogRead(xPin);<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; int y = analogRead(yPin);<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; int z = analogRead(zPin);<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>&nbsp; \/\/Are we flat in the X direction?<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; if (y &gt; T_SLANT) {<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \/\/Are we on our right side?<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (x &lt; T_RIGHT) {<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return IS_RIGHT;<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } <\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \/\/Are we on our left side?<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else if (x &gt; T_LEFT) {<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return IS_LEFT;<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } <\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else {<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \/\/We must be flat<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return IS_FLAT;<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; } <\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; else {<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \/\/We're slanted<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return IS_SLANT;<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; }<\/code><br \/><code>}<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>The code compares X or Y accelerometer values to determine whether any of the thresholds have been crossed then returns the appropriate constant to the loop function so it can execute the appropriate function based on the orientation. I could have put all of this code into the loop function, but that would have complicated things and made it harder to read. It was easier to demonstrate the code's functions in smaller chunks so my son could more easily understand what was going on.<\/p>\r\n<p>You may be wondering how I knew what threshold values to use. When I had everything wired up and working, I wrote some code that simply outputted the accelerometer values back to the Arduino IDE. In the setup function, I added the following code:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>Serial.begin(9600);<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>This told the application to open the serial port for output. Next, in my getOrientation function I added code that outputted the axis and value using the following:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>Serial.print(\"X: \");<\/code><br \/><code>Serial.println(x);<\/code><br \/><code>Serial.print(\"Y: \");<\/code><br \/><code>Serial.println(y);<\/code><br \/><code>Serial.print(\"Z: \");<\/code><br \/><code>Serial.println(z);<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>I then moved the car around and watched the different values on the screen. That's how I was able to determine which accelerometer value (x, y or z) was being affected and what threshold value to use. Once I had all the numbers I needed, I removed that code and was all ready to go.<\/p>\r\n<p>That's it; at this point, the car knows how to turn the lights on\/off and is able to determine its orientation via the accelerometer. All that's left is to fire the lights.<br \/>To simplify things, I made some helper functions I could use different ways in the code. The setLightStatus allows me to set a range of lights to a particular state (on or off). In the following example, I'm setting lights 5 through 9 to on (HIGH):<\/p>\r\n<p><code>setLightStatus(5, 10, HIGH);<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>\/\/====================================================<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/ Turn on\/off a range of lights<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/====================================================<\/code><br \/><code>void setLightStatus(int theStart, int theEnd, int theStatus) {<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; for (i = theStart; i &lt; theEnd; i++) {<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; digitalWrite(i, theStatus);<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; }<\/code><br \/><code>}<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>As described previously, I can affect all lights using:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>doAll(LOW);&nbsp; \/\/turns all lights off<\/code><br \/><code>doAll(HIGH);&nbsp; \/\/turns all lights on<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>\/\/====================================================<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/ Turn on\/off all of the lights<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/====================================================<\/code><br \/><code>void doAll(int status){<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; setLightStatus(0, 10, status);<\/code><br \/><code>}<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>When the application first runs, it blinks all of the lights twice using:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>\/\/====================================================<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/ Flash all of the lights twice<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/====================================================<\/code><br \/><code>void doBlinkBlink(){<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; doAll(HIGH);<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; delay(200);<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; doAll(LOW);<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; delay(100);<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; doAll(HIGH);<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; delay(200);<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; doAll(LOW);<\/code><br \/><code>}<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>This is, I know, very low tech, but it was a nice simple example for my son to comprehend.<\/p>\r\n<p>When the car is flat on a surface, it cycles through all of its lights in sequence using:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>\/\/====================================================<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/ Loop through the lights<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/ timeDel controls how long the each light stays on<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/====================================================<\/code><br \/><code>void doCycle(int timeDel){<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; for (i = 0; i &lt; numLights; i++) {<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \/\/Loop through all of the pins and turn the light on<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; digitalWrite(i, HIGH);<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \/\/Then wait for timeDel miliseconds<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; delay(timeDel);<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \/\/Then turn the light off<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; digitalWrite(i, LOW);<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; }<\/code><br \/><code>}<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>This is an example of where starting my digital output pins at pin 0 allowed me to create a simple for loop to process all lights in sequence. In this function, I pass in a timeDel variable that tells the function how long to keep each light on (in milliseconds). You could modify this so that the light spends an equal amount of time off by adding another delay after turning the light off.<\/p>\r\n<p>I made separate functions for turning each light group on:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>\/\/====================================================<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/ Turn on all of the Blue lights<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/ then wait a little bit<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/====================================================<\/code><br \/><code>void doAllBlue(int timeDel){<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; for (i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) {<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; digitalWrite(blueLights[i], HIGH);<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; }<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; delay(timeDel);<\/code><br \/><code>}<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>\/\/====================================================<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/ Turn on all of the Orange lights<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/ then wait a little bit<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/====================================================<\/code><br \/><code>void doAllOrange(int timeDel){<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; for (i = 0; i &lt; 2; i++) {<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; digitalWrite(orangeLights[i], HIGH);<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; }<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; delay(timeDel);<\/code><br \/><code>}<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>\/\/====================================================<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/ Turn on all of the Yellow lights<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/ then wait a little bit<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/====================================================<\/code><br \/><code>void doAllYellow(int timeDel){<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; for (i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) {<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; digitalWrite(yellowLights[i], HIGH);<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; }<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; delay(timeDel);<\/code><br \/><code>}<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>Then I cycled through each light group using the following:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>\/\/====================================================<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/ Light the lights in bands, blue first, then<\/code><br \/><code>\/\/ yellow, to orange and back again. <\/code><br \/><code>\/\/====================================================<\/code><br \/><code>void doBlend(int timeDel){<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; doAllBlue(timeDel);<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; doAll(LOW);<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; doAllYellow(timeDel);<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; doAll(LOW);<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; doAllOrange(timeDel);<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; doAll(LOW);<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; doAllYellow(timeDel);<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; doAll(LOW);<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp; doAllBlue(timeDel);<\/code><br \/><code>}<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>This code lights each light group for a certain amount of time (passed in the timeDel variable): Blue then yellow, then orange, then yellow and finally blue again. This is the frenetic pattern I used when the car is sitting in the starting gate.<\/p>\r\n<h1>Wrap-Up<\/h1>\r\n<p>The cool thing about this project is that there's a lot more that you can do with it. In this article, we showed you how to build and program the electronics, but what you do with it is all up to you. You can make your own light patterns and pair the electronics with the fanciest (or simplest) car your imagination can come up with.<\/p>\r\n<p>I know that with the appropriate accelerometer and\/or gyroscope you can use it to determine whether a device is in motion &ndash; since my son and were just getting into this, I focused on orientation rather than motion. A cool enhancement to this is to flash the lights in an even more frenetic pattern while the car is in motion.<\/p>\r\n<p>I'm sure that you can write much cleaner and more concise C code for your project. Remember, that what I did here was more for educating my son than showing how well I can write code.<\/p>\r\n<p>I'd like to maintain a public gallery of the different cars you create from this article, so when you have your car running, send me a tweet with a picture or video link to @johnwargo and I'll publish them somewhere.<\/p>","state":"1","catid":"41","created":"2016-04-14 23:45:10","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2016-04-16 18:50:44","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2016-04-14 23:45:10","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"33","ordering":"23","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"12975","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"453","asset_id":"594","title":"Nexus Support Euphoria","alias":"nexus-support-euphoria","introtext":"<p>I switched to Android a few years ago. I was a diehard BlackBerry fan for a very long time, but things just got&hellip;weird with BlackBerry, so I migrated to Android. I&rsquo;ve had several Samsung devices, but I didn&rsquo;t like any of them because Samsung adds too much extra junk to Android. Give me pure and simple Android and I&rsquo;m OK.<\/p>\r\n<p>Last Christmas, I invested in a Google Nexus 5x device. Having owned several Nexus 7 devices, I knew this would be a good device for me. I especially liked the device because of fingerprint scanner on the back. My employer rightly requires a password on the device and I was essentially not able to use any of the voice commands while driving simply because it was too hard to unlock the device while driving. The fingerprint scanner on the 5x is awesome since all I have to do it tap it with my (registered) finger and the device unlocks.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, last weekend I was making an update to the garage door controller app I wrote and plugged the device into my development system to install the latest version. Immediately Windows started complaining about a power surge in the USB port and shutdown the port. I scratched my head a bit, poked around and discovered that the device wasn&rsquo;t charging using any chargers or USB cables. Since changing cables didn&rsquo;t change anything, I knew the device was hosed.<\/p>\r\n<p>The device is only about 3 months old, so I knew I&rsquo;d be able to get warranty repair for it. The only thing I didn&rsquo;t know was how to get that support and how painful it would be. Little did I know that I was way, way off on how hard it would be.<\/p>\r\n<p>I waited until Monday to work on this and started my day by searching Google for nexus 5 repair. I quickly found the official support page and with the minimum of clicks I was on the phone with an English speaking support technician. From the site I was able to request a callback and within seconds someone was helping me. No IVR hell, no waiting in a queue, no having to prove that I&rsquo;d done all the right things to troubleshoot it. The technician listened to what I told her about my troubleshooting steps, agreed with me that it was broken and worked very hard to get it fixed for me. I was amazed.<\/p>\r\n<p>It took me about an hour on the phone to get this all resolved &ndash; not because it was hard to work with her or she had multiple steps to go through to get my device fixed. Instead, neither of us could find my order, so that is the only reason it took so long. Whew.<\/p>\r\n<p>I received a replacement device the very next day.<\/p>\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve migrated between Android devices lately, but the process is pretty cool. During setup of the new device, you&rsquo;re prompted to go to your old device and start the migration process. Once started about two minutes later everything (and I pretty much do mean everything) is transferred. I had to redo my Bluetooth pairings and login to my apps, but everything else was completely taken care of for me. Excellent.<\/p>\r\n<p>Being a modern, technical guy, I immediately tweeted about my euphoria over my support experience:<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/nexus-1.png\" alt=\"Nexus twitter image \" height=\"148\" width=\"300\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Within seconds, someone from the Google Nexus support team saw my tweet (OK, it&rsquo;s probably a bot, but who cares &ndash; this is cool) and offered to help:<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/nexus-2.png\" alt=\"Nexus twitter image 2\" height=\"206\" width=\"300\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>So, I didn&rsquo;t even have to go to the support site, I could have tweeted &ldquo;my Nexus 5x is broken&rdquo; and gotten immediate help. How cool is that?<\/p>\r\n<p>The conversation continued:<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/nexus-3.png\" alt=\"Nexus twitter image 3\" height=\"148\" width=\"300\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>And the helpful, happy response:<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/nexus-4.png\" alt=\"Nexus twitter image 4\" height=\"207\" width=\"300\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m pretty impressed with how easy this was. The device broke, which I&rsquo;m not entirely happy about, but the experience was so painless that I simply didn&rsquo;t mind.

I&rsquo;ve poked and prodded at it when I worked for BlackBerry and wrote my BlackBerry development book, but I&rsquo;ve not done much serious Java development in my career. I&rsquo;ve been working on a Particle Photon-based garage door controller and I built a web app and an Apache Cordova version of the app to interact with the controller. I also wanted a native Android app for this, so I got to work learning Android development. I picked up a copy of the Big Nerd Ranch guide to Android Development (<a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/22D68vF\">http:\/\/amzn.to\/22D68vF<\/a>) and got to work.<\/p>\r\n<p>As I learned new skills working through the guide, I&rsquo;d finish a chapter then go back to my garage door controller app and implement it there as well. I reached a point where I had everything setup on the photon and the Particle cloud with the app well tested using the web and Cordova versions of the controller app. At this point, I needed to be able to do an HTTP POST from the Android app. I got an example of it working with the standard Android HTTP libraries, but I was looking for a simpler implementation. I stumbled upon the OKHTTP library and tried to figure out how to make it work for me.<\/p>\r\n<p>I needed to send an HTTP POST to the Particle Cloud and I couldn&rsquo;t find a single example that showed me how to do it using OKHTTP.

It&rsquo;s telling me there&rsquo;s a gate change, great, useful information. What&rsquo;s the next piece of information I need? Well, I do need to know which flight, but in this case, I only had one flight that day, so telling me what the flight number and the source and destination airport is useless to me.

The new gate number. In this example, they&rsquo;re telling me there&rsquo;s a gate change, good information to have. Next they&rsquo;re telling me which flight &ndash; good, that&rsquo;s good. The next most important information for me is which gate do I now have to walk to?

{"id":"459","asset_id":"603","title":"Pi Reminder Updates","alias":"pi-reminder-updates","introtext":"<p>My Pi Reminder project went online at Makezine.com and since then I’ve been hearing from readers. One reader has made a couple of updates to the code which are now available online at <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/pi-remind.\">https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/pi-remind.<\/a> Here’s a summary of the updates:<\/p>\r\n<h2>Time Zone Processing<\/h2>\r\n<p>This project is my first attempt at Python coding; I was surprised at how quickly I was able to pick it up. That 30 years of experience in software development really paid off as I was working to learn Python. As I coded the app, I had to work though how to manipulate the Google Calendar’s use of UTC. To filter the event list to return only appointments in the future, I had to convert the current time to UTC and pass it to the cloud API. I poked around a bit and struggled a bit to figure out how to get the time in the right format, so I hardcoded my current time zone in the conversion process. I expected that I’d point this out so other folks could adjust that calculation for their time zone, but forgot to do so in the original article. Fortunately for me, reader John McCabe ran across this hardcoded code and implemented a nice, clean fix for it which I’ve merged with the live code.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Empty Event Descriptions<\/h2>\r\n<p>When I built the app, the only calendar I had to work with was mine. As I use the calendar in a work environment, all of my events were in pretty pristine condition. Unfortunately, the code didn’t take into account events that didn’t have a summary (a description\/title). I’m not sure why you’d want an event without a description, but I tested it and apparently Google Calendar doesn’t mind. John McCabe implemented a fix for this and I’ve merged it in. He also taught me an interesting way to use Python’s if-in capability in the process.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Known Issue: Cancelled Events<\/h2>\r\n<p>I recently noticed that Pi Remind was notifying me of canceled events. I have the Google Calendar feature enabled that allows me to see canceled appointments on my calendar. I enabled this in case I declined an invitation but later found I was available to attend. The Google Calendar API returns those canceled events, even when I have showDeleted set to false, so this is an open issue I’m going to have to fix. Stay tuned on this one.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"41","created":"2016-06-21 15:16:21","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2018-12-21 13:03:41","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2016-06-21 22:00:00","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/2016\\\/pi-reminder-in-stand-cropped-640.png\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/2016\\\/pi-reminder-in-stand-cropped-640.png\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"4","ordering":"20","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"9168","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

One was a Particle Photon project that I hope to write about soon, and the other is a Raspberry Pi project that I&rsquo;ve not completed yet. As I worked on each of these projects, I found myself wiring up one or more LEDs and connecting it to the microcontroller so I could validate whether the code is working correctly. Yes, I know I could tell the relay is firing by the click it makes when I fire it, but I wanted something visual.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, while browsing around on the Adafruit web site, I discovered their Perma-Proto boards (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/591\">https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/591<\/a>). These things are breadboards (of a sort) that you solder components into. They&rsquo;re a nice, easy way to quickly build projects in a more permanent way.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/adafruit-perma-proto-board.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1 - Adafruit Proto-board - Image used with permission<\/p>\r\n<p>I bought a handful and they sat around for a while looking for something to do. As I wired up yet another LED configuration, I remembered these boards and started thinking. I decided to create a relay testing jig using a proto-board, some LEDs, resistors and a battery. You can see the finished project in the following figure.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/relay-testing-jig-cropped-640.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2 - Relay Testing Jig<\/p>\r\n<p>The battery provides power for each of the LEDs, but the negative wire to the LED is broken (the pairs of colored wire at the top of the figure). When you put AA batteries in the holder then collect one or more pair of colored wires to a relay, you have a simple jig you can easily wire in to help you test the software before you finish building the final hardware project. Connect both wires of the same color to the relay&rsquo;s NO or NC connections and you&rsquo;re set.<\/p>\r\n<p>Here's a rough circuit diagram. My long term goal (who knows, perhaps it will become a short term goal) is to learn how to use Fritzing.

When I started the blog, I was carrying a BlackBerry device and Android and iOS usage was on the rise, so I could give marketers credit for not thinking about mobile users as most email was still read on desktop PCs and laptops. Fast forward 100 years (well, OK, 4-8 years or so) and for many companies, not much has changed.<\/p>\r\n<p>I use a desktop PC &ndash; mostly because I&rsquo;m a developer and it&rsquo;s much easier to code on a full keyboard with an enormous monitor. But, market trends show that desktop and laptop sales are down; that people are using their smartphones and probably a tablet for their day to day computing stuff. Even I&rsquo;m using my tablet for email browsing in the evenings. So, what&rsquo;s the deal with marketing companies and their email blasts?<br \/>Take a look at the following images, each of them are screenshots from my Nexus 5X which has a pretty potent resolution. Each of them is an HTML-format email specifically designed for larger screens (like a tablet, laptop or desktop PC). I have reasonable expectations, I don&rsquo;t expect much content to be above the fold in these emails, I expect to have to scroll or swipe down once my interest is piqued. I do, however, expect them to render correctly horizontally so that I can read the content without having to also swipe the page left and right to read everything.<\/p>\r\n<p>We know that HTML and CSS are capable of delivering content to these devices in a responsive way, rendering the content cleanly on smaller devices &ndash; we&rsquo;ve all done that to our web sites, right? Why are marketing folks ignoring email clients as well? They have to know that the content will likely be read first on a mobile device, then, if the user wants to know more, they&rsquo;ll click and visit the web site (which is mobile-friendly) for more details. Designers and marketers have to start thinking about the primary way this content will likely be read and adjust their designs to accommodate. I care about these emails, I did after all sign up to receive them, but if they&rsquo;re not compatible with smartphone screens I&rsquo;m simply not going to read them.<\/p>\r\n<p>{gallery}2016\/email-format{\/gallery}<\/p>\r\n<p>I'll add additional images to this gallery as I uncover more poorly formatted email messages.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"0","catid":"15","created":"2016-07-14 13:16:58","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2016-07-14 13:25:09","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2016-07-14 13:16:58","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"3","ordering":"34","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"7668","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"0","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

In a subsequent update to the Google libraries, Google now places its configuration file in the same folder where the application executes. Refer to the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/pi-remind-hd#changing-the-google-profile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">project's readme<\/a> for additional information.<\/p>\r\n<p>I’m in the process of changing jobs, so after I left my previous employer’s employment, I needed to reconfigure the Pi Reminder app to point it to my personal calendar profile instead of my work profile. If you remember the process, when you execute the Pi Reminder code on the Raspberry for the first time, it walks you through a process of authorizing the app to access your calendar (shown in Figure 1).<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/pi-remind-delete-auth-00.png\" alt=\"Google Calendar Authorization Page\" width=\"602\" height=\"441\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1 – Authorizing Pi Reminder to Access a Google Calendar<\/p>\r\n<p>When you complete this process, the Google Calendar API creates a hidden file on the Pi that contains the access token generated as part of this process. When it’s time to switch the Pi Reminder to use a new profile, all you have to do is delete that file.<\/p>\r\n<p>Note: Before you can continue, you’ll need to stop the pi_reminder.py process as it’s using the file we need to remove. If you ran the application manually in a terminal window, just terminate the process by closing the terminal window. If you’re like me and you used the desktop file I included in the project, then you’ll need to delete the file in the ~\/.config\/autostart folder. You can delete it then reboot the Pi before continuing with the remaining steps. Once we’re done, restore the file from the trash, reboot and you’ll be all set.<\/p>\r\n<p>In my experience, Python code doesn’t like running as the Pi user, so in my instructions for starting the Pi Reminder code, I had you execute the code using the Linux sudo command. A side-effect of that is that the Google Calendar access token file is created by the root user and is not visible to normal users like the pi user. So, to whack the file (‘whack’ is a technical term for ‘delete’) you’ll need to do it with elevated privileges.<\/p>\r\n<p>Note: There’s probably a lot of different ways you can do this, but I’m not a Linux expert, so I’m just going to show you how I did it. If you have a better way, that’s great, I don’t necessarily need to hear about it since this approach worked quite well for me.<\/p>\r\n<p>Start by opening a terminal window. Once there, execute the following command:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>sudo pcmanfm<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>The terminal will display the output shown in Figure 2 then open the Raspbian file manager application (shown in Figure 3), PCManFM.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/pi-remind-delete-auth-01.png\" alt=\"Raspbian terminal window\" width=\"657\" height=\"427\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2 – Raspbian Terminal Application<\/p>\r\n<p>In the file manager, navigate to the file system’s \/root folder as shown in the figure then double-click the .credentials folder to open it.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/pi-remind-delete-auth-02.png\" alt=\"Raspbian file manger window\" width=\"642\" height=\"517\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 3 – Raspbian File Manager<\/p>\r\n<p>Inside the folder is a file called pi_remind.json (shown in Figure 4), that’s the file we’re looking for.

{"id":"466","asset_id":"610","title":"PyMongo & Google Charts Data Tables","alias":"pymongo-google-charts-data-tables","introtext":"<p>I’m working on a project that involves graphing data from a MongoDB collection using Google Charts. For this particular project, I’m collecting weather data (temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure) data on a Raspberry Pi, storing it in a MongoDB collection and delivering a web interface for viewing and graphing the data. I’m built the web interface using Flask (<a href=\"http:\/\/flask.pocoo.org\/\">http:\/\/flask.pocoo.org\/<\/a>), so there’s some flaskness in the sample code.<\/p>\r\n<p>As I worked on the part of the web app that graphs the weather data, I decided to use Google Charts as the client-side rendering library. I’d not worked with it before, so this seemed like a good way to learn it. As I poked and prodded at the Charts documentation, I learned that I had to deliver my data in a specific format for Google Charts to be able to make use of it, and the data coming out of the Python Mongo driver (pymongo) wasn’t giving me what I needed, or at least, wasn’t giving it to me in a usable format. I had find working, so I was able to get the data I needed from the collection, but it had to be reformatted before sending it to Google Charts.<\/p>\r\n<p>Here’s a complete Python snippet that shows how to do it:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>from bson.json_util import dumps<\/code><br \/><code>from config import Config<\/code><br \/><code>from flask import Flask<\/code><br \/><code>from flask_pymongo import PyMongo<\/code><br \/><br \/><code>app = Flask(__name__)<\/code><br \/><code># setup the parameters for our MongoDB connection<\/code><br \/><code>app.config['MONGO_HOST'] = Config.MONGO_URL<\/code><br \/><code>app.config['MONGO_PORT'] = Config.MONGO_PORT<\/code><br \/><code>app.config['MONGO_DBNAME'] = Config.MONGO_DB<\/code><br \/><code>app.config['MONGO_USERNAME'] = Config.MONGO_USER<\/code><br \/><code>app.config['MONGO_PASSWORD'] = Config.MONGO_PASSWORD<\/code><br \/><br \/><code># this project is using Flask, so initialize the mongo driver with app information<\/code><br \/><code>mongo = PyMongo(app)<\/code><br \/><br \/><code># search the collection for data<\/code><br \/><code>cursor = mongo.db.measurements.find(search_criteria, field_list).sort(sort_criteria)<\/code><br \/><code># did we get data back from the call to find()?<\/code><br \/><code>if cursor:<\/code><br \/><code> print(\"Cursor contains {} documents\".format(cursor.count()))<\/code><br \/><code> # create an empty results object<\/code><br \/><code> data_list = []<\/code><br \/><code> # now loop through all of the documents in the cursor<\/code><br \/><code> for doc in cursor: <\/code><br \/><code> value_list = [doc['timestamp'], doc['temp_f'], doc['humidity'], doc['pressure']]<\/code><br \/><code> data_list.append(value_list)<\/code><br \/><code> return dumps(data_list)<\/code><br \/><code>else:<\/code><br \/><code> print(\"Cursor is empty\")<\/code><br \/><code> # return an empty result<\/code><br \/><code> return \"[]\"<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>Let’s tear apart the code…<\/p>\r\n<p>To query the Mongo collection, you use pymongo’s find() method:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>cursor = mongo.db.measurements.find(search_criteria, field_list).sort(sort_criteria)<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>In this case, I pass in a Python object describing the search criteria, {} to get all documents for example, which fields I want returned and a specific sort order. I’m not going to describe each of those as the Pymongo documentation describes them pretty well.<\/p>\r\n<p>The call to find() returns a cursor, basically a pointer to a result set. To process the results, you can iterate through the cursor, which I’ll show you in a minute, or you can simply return the data in the default JSON format using:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>return dumps(cursor)<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>In my use case, I needed the data as an array of arrays (the Google Charts Data Table format), so I’ll have to iterate through the results and build my array of arrays as I go:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>if cursor:<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # create an empty results object<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; data_list = []<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # now loop through all of the documents in the cursor<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for doc in cursor:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; value_list = [doc['timestamp'], doc['temp_f'], doc['humidity'], doc['pressure']]<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; data_list.append(value_list)<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return dumps(data_list)<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>The first thing the code does is checks to see if there’s even a cursor; just in case the call to find() failed for some reason. Once the app knows it has data, it loops through the data and creates an array containing the measurement values then appends the new array to an existing array of results data.<\/p>\r\n<p>Where the call to dumps(cursor) would return something like the following:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>[{\"pressure\": 25.77, \"temp_f\": 82.9, \"timestamp\": \"July 21, 2016 @ 08:50 AM\", \"humidity\": 80.0}, {\"pressure\": 28.2, \"temp_f\": 80.1, \"timestamp\": \"July 21, 2016 @ 08:40 AM\", \"humidity\": 10.0}, {\"pressure\": 25.55, \"temp_f\": 72.1, \"timestamp\": \"July 21, 2016 @ 08:30 AM\", \"humidity\": 70.0}, {\"pressure\": 25.97, \"temp_f\": 71.2, \"timestamp\": \"July 21, 2016 @ 08:20 AM\", \"humidity\": 40.0}]<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>This code returns something like the following:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>[[1469105400679, 82.9, 80.0, 25.77], [1469104800002, 80.1, 10.0, 28.2],<\/code><br \/><code>[1469104200326, 72.1, 70.0, 25.55], [1469103600652, 71.2, 40.0, 25.97],<\/code><br \/><code>[1469103000986, 74.8, 80.0, 27.36], [1469102400331, 72.9, 50.0, 29.52], <\/code><br \/><code>[1469101800670, 72.5, 10.0, 29.32], [1469101200010, 75.7, 60.0, 27.72]]<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>Although I am taking a little liberty with the time format, the examples are just examples of format, not real data.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now, if you know anything about Google Charts Data Table format, you were probably wondering why I didn’t include any column information in the results returned from the server app. That’s because this app accommodates mobile devices and, since the column data never changes, I chose not to send it repeatedly over the wireless app. Instead, I added the code to setup the data table on the client application in the following JavaScript code:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>$.getJSON(chart_url, function () {<\/code><br \/><code>&nbsp;

{"id":"467","asset_id":"611","title":"Formatting Email Content for Usefulness on Mobile","alias":"formatting-email-content-for-usefulness-on-mobile","introtext":"<p>I posted a little while ago about how marketing organizations were ignoring mobile clients when crafting email blasts and provided some examples (which I continue to update as I find more). My analysis of these emails focused mainly on how the email messages are not formatted correctly for smaller devices, but as I looked into this more, I realized that many of these email messages, not marketing blasts, but specific notification emails sent directly to me, weren&rsquo;t structured in a way that made them immediately useful to me as the consumer. Take the following email notification from American Airlines for example:<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/email-formatting-for-use-640.png\" alt=\"American Airlines Flight Notification\" height=\"1138\" width=\"640\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1 &ndash; American Airlines Departure Reminder Email<\/p>\r\n<p>When you look at the email on my Nexus 5x device as shown in the figure, there is no useful information displayed once I open the email. All I can tell by looking at this email is that I have a departure coming up and that it has a specific record locator. The developer who crafted this email message paid no attention to providing me with useful information above the fold (in the first page displayed).<\/p>\r\n<p>When companies craft notification messages, they need to focus on organizing the content so the reader gets the most important information as quickly as possible. Newspapers and even magazine articles are structured in a pyramid format, with the most important information at the top of an article. They do this so that editors can easily trim the article to fit a particular amount of available space without losing the story; the side effect is that users get more quickly to the important part of the content.<\/p>\r\n<p>For mobile app content, content creators must focus on getting the user the pertinent details of the notification without forcing the user to scroll the page. As you can see from the figure, there&rsquo;s information there, but it&rsquo;s all (yes, all of it) useless. Users have no choice but to scroll the message in order to see the details.<\/p>\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s analyze the email content&hellip;<\/p>\r\n<p>In the subject line, for example, I can see that it&rsquo;s a departure reminder. That&rsquo;s good, I guess, but I probably already know that I&rsquo;m departing today. That text clarifies whether the email is a departure reminder or some other type of notification, so I guess that&rsquo;s OK, but still not a very good use of the space. Next they tell me it&rsquo;s a reminder for, well, me. This email was sent to my personal inbox, who else would the reminder be for? Why do they have to inform me that the reminder is for John Wargo when they know they sent the reminder to John Wargo&rsquo;s email account?<\/p>\r\n<p>Now, I recognize that some executives have their travel managed by their assistants, and those assistants may cover multiple executives, so letting me know who the reminder is for, in that case, might be useful. But, of the millions of users who receive these notifications, how many of them are sent to assistants? 1%? 5%? 10%? Should you accommodate the outliers or do you accommodate the majority of your users when formatting notification content? The majority, please; there&rsquo;s no need to remind me that the departure reminder I&rsquo;m getting is for me. If you&rsquo;re sending me a departure notification for someone other than me, then including the name of the traveler does make sense. So, for example, if sending a notification to my wife, which is something I have setup in my AA account, it would make sense to include my name in the reminder email. But, any departure notification she&rsquo;s going to receive is either going to be for her or for me, so there&rsquo;s still no need to include the traveler&rsquo;s name in the subject line.<\/p>\r\n<p>Next, the airline included the record locator for the flight I&rsquo;m being notified about. That&rsquo;s nice, but what am I supposed to do with that information? The record locator is useless information to me at this stage of my traveling experience. I know I can use the record locator to locate my record, and view the details of my current trip, but the app creating this email already had the record open, so why not skip the record locator and actually include details from the record instead?<\/p>\r\n<p>When you get to the body of the email, American Airlines has decided to include a header graphic that has their logo, plus links to perform actions on their web site. I understand the value of the brand&rsquo;s header graphic at the top of the email, that&rsquo;s expected. But why do they think I need a link that allows me to book a flight at this time? They&rsquo;re reminding me about a flight departure, and, so far no details about the flight&rsquo;s actual departure has been provided. However, I&rsquo;ve been given a link to use to do more business with the airline. Does that make sense? Also, as you can see, they didn&rsquo;t format the header so it scales correctly on the page, so other potential useful information is off on the hidden right side of the screen.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now onto the body of the email. As you can see, the content styling isn&rsquo;t setup to automatically wrap the content to the page width. You&rsquo;re teased that there&rsquo;s details about this particular flight coming up, but as of yet nothing interesting appears except for a repeat of the record locator. Why repeat the record locator when you&rsquo;ve not even provided me with any other details about the flight?<\/p>\r\n<p>So, what details of this flight are important for me to know in this notification? As I thought through this, the following list came to mind:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Destination City &ndash; I&rsquo;m flying and may have more than one flight today, so probably care most about which leg of the flight I&rsquo;m being notified about.<\/li>\r\n<li>Departure City &ndash; Seeing this would help me understand exactly which flight leg we&rsquo;re talking about<\/li>\r\n<li>Flight Number &ndash; Isn&rsquo;t amazing that the airline has given me the record locator twice, but never once mentioned the flight number?<\/li>\r\n<li>Departure gate<\/li>\r\n<li>Status &ndash; what&rsquo;s the current status of the flight<\/li>\r\n<li>Planned departure time &ndash; this one and the following could be on the same line.<\/li>\r\n<li>Current departure time<\/li>\r\n<li>Planned arrival time &ndash; this one and the following could be on the same line.<\/li>\r\n<li>Expected arrival time<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>The order should probably be adjusted and some of the items can be listed together, but that&rsquo;s basically the gist of what I need to know about a flight in a departure notification. All (or at least most) of that information should appear on the initial screen that appears when the user opens the email.<\/p>\r\n<p>For a reasonably sized device, that information should appear without the reader needing to swipe a finger to see more. From what I know about HTML and CSS, that doesn&rsquo;t seem like that would be hard to accomplish, but American Airlines made no effort to do so.<\/p>\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what I would do: For the subject line, I would get the user to the most important information as quickly as possible:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Flight FLIGHT_NUMBER: STATUS, Gate GATE_NUMBER<\/p>\r\n<p>Or<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">DEPARTURE_CITY: STATUS, Gate GATE_NUMBER<\/p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s it. I know that I&rsquo;m flying and I know which airline sent the email, so I really don&rsquo;t need to know anything else in the subject line. With that information in place, I can tell, without even opening the email, whether I need to open the email and read more. If the details in the subject line are complete, there&rsquo;s actually no need to open the email unless I want more details.<\/p>\r\n<p>In the body of the message, I&rsquo;d include the airline logo (nothing more) since we do have to maintain the brand. There is no need to provide links to book a flight; I be analytics could prove that that particular link is never tapped on a mobile device. Next would come the specifics of the flight in more or less the order listed above.<\/p>\r\n<p>Any additional information, including links to do other things with the airline (like book a flight) I would add as links to the BOTTOM of the email. That way, once I&rsquo;ve been properly informed, I can scroll down and interact in other ways with the airlines. I would definitely add a promo code to entice the customer to purchase something (like a discounted drink or meal) before the flight.<\/p>\r\n<p>The best litmus test for app or email UI verification is how many actions does it take to get the user to the exact information they need at the time they need it:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The best option is none; the user gets a notification, the notification appears in the device&rsquo;s notification area and displays enough information to impart some knowledge to the reader. That&rsquo;s the best approach and not actually that hard to accomplish if you actually work at it. In this case, the user never needs to even open the email or email client.<\/li>\r\n<li>Next comes one action; the user has to open their email client. Once the message appears in the messages list, if the subject line is thoughtfully crafted, the user can gain useful knowledge by simply reading the subject line.<\/li>\r\n<li>Barely acceptable is two actions; the user has to open the email client and open the email message.<\/li>\r\n<li>Unacceptable is what I&rsquo;ve shown above; the user has to open the email client, open the email message, AND then scroll down in the message to gain useful insights into the flight&rsquo;s status. I&rsquo;m assuming here that useful information will be visible after only one swipe, it&rsquo;s possible more than one swipe will be needed to get to the useful information and that would be horrible.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>As developers, we have to stand up and be thoughtful in how we impart information in small spaces. The email shown above was created from the airline&rsquo;s perspective; the record locator is how they think of the reservation, so the developer implementing this system applied that same thought process to the message content. She (or he) didn&rsquo;t put themselves in the reader&rsquo;s shoes and organize the content in the way that made the most sense to the content&rsquo;s target. That&rsquo;s a shameful lack of effort in what could be a great opportunity to impress a customer in his time of need.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"0","catid":"14","created":"2016-07-27 22:51:05","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2016-07-27 22:54:28","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2016-07-27 22:51:05","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"3","ordering":"19","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"6568","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"0","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"468","asset_id":"612","title":"Doing Account Creation Right","alias":"doing-account-creation-right","introtext":"<p>As I strive to pick up new technologies and start new projects, I&rsquo;m regularly finding myself registering for new services, accounts or access to specific websites or forums. As part of this process, I&rsquo;ve noticed two things:<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Very few web form developers use the (no longer) new HTML input types (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.w3schools.com\/html\/html_form_input_types.asp\">http:\/\/www.w3schools.com\/html\/html_form_input_types.asp<\/a>) like email, date, time, url, and so on.<\/li>\r\n<li>Security requirements force a specific set of minimum password requirements, but web form developers rarely let you know that they even exist, or what they are, until AFTER you&rsquo;ve submitted credentials that don&rsquo;t meet the requirements.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>In my mind, the first one indicates that the developer isn&rsquo;t thinking about mobile users (which have special keyboards for the specific input types) and isn&rsquo;t interested in making input easier on mobile devices. I wrote <a target=\"_self\" href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=427:email-input-on-the-web&amp;catid=14:category-mobile-development&amp;Itemid=138\">a post about this topic here<\/a> and shared some examples, so this isn&rsquo;t the focus of this post.<\/p>\r\n<p>The second one tells me that developers aren&rsquo;t thinking very carefully through the whole registration process. They seem to feel that the present, populate, submit, validate, kickback, fix, and submit again process is reasonable for registrants, when a simple present, inform, populate, submit, and validate process is much more efficient (see Figure 1).<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/Account-Creation-Form-Flows.png\" height=\"435\" width=\"800\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1 &ndash; Registration Process Flows<\/p>\r\n<p>Unless I&rsquo;m able to somehow divine the password requirements in advance, without you telling me, the registration process most developers implement forces users to submit the registration form twice. I don&rsquo;t have the numbers, but it would be very interesting to see some analytics data on one of these forms to see how often users are actually able to guess the password requirements. For sites with more complex password requirements, I imagine that the number of users who have resubmit is at least 80%.<\/p>\r\n<p>What developers must do is list any password complexity requirements on the registration form from the very beginning. When you do this, you&rsquo;ll eliminate the majority of your validation errors except for those cases where the user isn&rsquo;t paying attention. I&rsquo;m experienced, so I know that most sites will have password complexity requirements, so I&rsquo;ll look for details regarding the requirements before I tap the submit button. If I don&rsquo;t find them, which is the majority of the time, I pick a simple password and submit it to see if it will work.<\/p>\r\n<p>What most developers do, is assume it&rsquo;s OK to tell the users what the password complexity requirements are during the validation kickback process. That works, but it&rsquo;s too late. The user has already made an investment to populate the form using all of the information you provided and you failed him. This approach requires that the user fail before they&rsquo;re provided with the information they need to be successful. If they&rsquo;re successful on the first try, it&rsquo;s because:<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>They made a lucky guess<\/li>\r\n<li>They&rsquo;re default approach to passwords accidentally meets your minimum requirements<\/li>\r\n<li>Your password complexity requirements are not complex enough for most users<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>The folks at MongoDB recently launched a cloud hosting service (cloud.mongodb.com), and did a really great job on their registration form (see Figure 2). Not only are you told up front what the password complexity requirements are, you can see visually how many of the requirements you have met. That&rsquo;s the way it should be done. At a minimum, list the requirements on the form from the moment it&rsquo;s served. As a bonus, show the user how they&rsquo;re doing as they populate the form.<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/account-creation-form.png\" height=\"600\" width=\"800\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2 &ndash; MongoDB Cloud Registration Form<\/p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, the MongoDB folks failed at using the right input types in their form.

I dropped a bunch of weight a few years ago and it helps me stay on track when I track it. My blood pressure has been wonky, so tracking that is a good thing as well. I&rsquo;d like to get one of those scales and a Sphygmomanometer that automatically updates the app, but for now I&rsquo;m doing it manually.<\/p>\r\n<p>Every week or so, the Withings app sends me an email summary of my stats. In this morning&rsquo;s email, they offered me a chance to set a weight goal, and I quickly clicked on the link. After logging me in, I&rsquo;m presented with the following form:<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/withings-weight-goal.png\" alt=\"Withings Set Weight Goal\" width=\"560\" height=\"446\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>As you can see, it&rsquo;s asking me to set my goal (my desired weight). So, recognizing where my weight currently is, I decided that my goal should be 230 lbs. and I dutifully tried to enter that value. Apparently I can&rsquo;t do that.<\/p>\r\n<p>You can't tell from the figure, but the input field is a spinner, with up and down arrows you can use to increase and decrease the value. For some bizarre reason, they&rsquo;ve setup the form so those UI helpers disappear when the field loses focus. That&rsquo;s not helpful.<\/p>\r\n<p>The form&rsquo;s asking me for my desired weight, and I&rsquo;m trying to enter my desired weight, but it won&rsquo;t let me. I guess, I can&rsquo;t tell from any of the details on the form, they&rsquo;re asking me to enter a weight difference, not an actual weight target &ndash; but then how exactly is that a weight goal? By asking me for a weight difference, apparently I&rsquo;m supposed to be entering a weight loss goal, not a weight goal. Sigh.<\/p>\r\n<p>Notice too that the input field allows me to spin to a negative number; apparently the developer of this form didn&rsquo;t know about the HTML input field &lsquo;min&rsquo; attribute (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.w3schools.com\/tags\/att_input_min.asp\">http:\/\/www.w3schools.com\/tags\/att_input_min.asp<\/a>) that would have allowed him (or her) to restrict the input to only positive numbers.<\/p>\r\n<p>Notice as well that I can only set a weight loss goal of 7 lbs. or greater. What if I only needed to lose 5 lbs., apparently I would not be able to set such a worthless goal using this form.<\/p>\r\n<p>Input forms must be designed so the form&rsquo;s user knows exactly what is expected of them. The form&rsquo;s content should be updated so it&rsquo;s clear I&rsquo;m setting a weight loss goal, not a weight goal. The input field should have its min attribute set so, first of all, the user can&rsquo;t set a negative weight loss goal, and so any positive value is acceptable. It&rsquo;s all fine and dandy that you want me to set goals of 7 lbs. or more, perhaps I have more reasonable expectations and know I can only lose 4 lbs. by a specific date.<\/p>\r\n<p>Is the desired weight field required? You betcha it is. How about target date? Yep, that one is too. Do you see any visual indication that any of the fields on the form are required? That&rsquo;s another requirement &ndash; that users be able know clearly which fields they must populate to submit the form.<\/p>\r\n<p>As I&rsquo;ve proven, this form is completely useless and it was worth more effort than was needed for me to understand how to use the form. It&rsquo;s not rocket science folks, create input forms that are clear, succinct, well documented and easy to use.

In order to easily accommodate that potential requirement, I decided to implement my solution using a script file.<\/p>\r\n<p>To start, I created a simple script file that starts my Python app:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>#!\/bin\/bash<\/code><br \/><code>echo \"Starting Pi Remind\"<\/code><br \/><code>\/usr\/bin\/sudo python \/home\/pi\/pi_remind\/remind.py<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>Notice that for this app, it will only run under supervisor privileges, so I execute the python command using sudo. The python command happens to be in the \/usr\/bin\/ folder, alongside sudo, so I didn&rsquo;t need to provide a full path to the python command in the bash script.<\/p>\r\n<p>Before enabling auto startup, I&rsquo;d probably better test the script first, right? Open a terminal window, navigate to the folder where the script is located and execute the following command:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>.\/start-remind.sh<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>You got a permission denied error message, right? That&rsquo;s the first fault point in this process, the bash script is solid, but the OS simply doesn&rsquo;t know it can execute it. So, before you can execute the bash script, you have to set its execution bit using the following:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>chmod +x start-remind.sh<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>With that in place, you should be able to execute the script from the terminal.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now on to the next potential problem. When I first crafted my app, I expected that I&rsquo;d execute it directly from the app folder using:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>sudo python .\/remind.py<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>So I didn&rsquo;t pay any special attention to how the app accessed local files. That creates a problem for auto startup. Let me give you an example.<\/p>\r\n<p>In one of my apps, I opened the app&rsquo;s configuration file using the following code:<\/p>\r\n<p><code># setup the config parser<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>Config = ConfigParser.ConfigParser()<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>print(\"\\nOpening configuration file\")<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>try:<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp; # read the configuration file<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp; Config.read(\"\/config.ini\")<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>except:<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp; print(\"Exception:\", sys.exc_info()[0], slash_n)<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp; sys.exit(1)<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>That worked wonderfully when executing my app from the folder where it resides. As soon as I tried to execute it from a startup script, it would fail miserably and NOT show me any indicators as to why it wasn&rsquo;t working. The solution? Test the script from another folder, like this:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>cd \/<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>\/home\/pi\/pi_remind\/start-remind.sh<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>The terminal window will remain open and you can view, and correct, any errors that appear. For my app, I had to replace the code anywhere where I tried to open a local file, and instead pass the complete path to the project folder like this:<\/p>\r\n<p><code># setup the config parser<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>Config = ConfigParser.ConfigParser()<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>print(\"\\nOpening configuration file\")<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>try:<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp; # read the configuration file<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp; # this could be executed from anywhere, so be sure to append the script path<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp; # to the file name so it loads via an absolute path instead<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp; Config.read(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)) + \"\/config.ini\")<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>except:<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp; print(\"Exception:\", sys.exc_info()[0], slash_n)<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp; sys.exit(1)<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>With that script file in place, the script will execute from anywhere and I&rsquo;m ready to go.<\/p>\r\n<p>I found two ways to execute my script that worked for me. The first is to create a .desktop file and copy it to ~\/.config\/autostart. For my use case, I called the file start-remind.desktop. Populate the file with the following information:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>[Desktop Entry]<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>Name=Pi Remind<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>Comment=Raspberry Pi Calendar Reminder App<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>Exec=lxterminal -e \"\/home\/pi\/pi_remind\/start-remind.sh\"<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>Icon=<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>StartupNotify=true<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>Terminal=true<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>X-MultipleArgs=false<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>Type=Application<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>Categories=Utility;TerminalEmulator;<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>When you reboot the system, the OS parses the .desktop file and loads the bash script.<\/p>\r\n<p>Note: the only lines, I think, you really need are the following:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>[Desktop Entry]<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>Name=Pi Remind<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>Exec=lxterminal -e \"\/home\/pi\/pi_remind\/start-remind.sh\"<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>Type=Application<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s where I learned this trick: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.raspberrypi.org\/forums\/viewtopic.php?f=91&amp;t=80096\">https:\/\/www.raspberrypi.org\/forums\/viewtopic.php?f=91&amp;t=80096<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>The next solution is a little easier and you can read about it here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk\/2014\/05\/how-to-autostart-apps-in-rasbian-lxde-desktop\">http:\/\/www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk\/2014\/05\/how-to-autostart-apps-in-rasbian-lxde-desktop<\/a>. All you have to do is add an entry into a specific file and it will run your bash script at startup. Open a terminal window and execute the following command:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>sudo nano ~\/.config\/lxsession\/LXDE-pi\/autostart<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>Add the following lines to the end (bottom) of the file (you can see an example of this in the figure below):<\/p>\r\n<p><code>@lxterminal -e \/home\/pi\/pi_weather\/start-station.sh<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>To save your changes, press ctrl-o then press the Enter key. Next, press ctrl-x to exit the nano application. Reboot the Raspberry Pi. When it restarts, both python processes should execute in terminal window as expected.<\/p>\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s an example from a project I&rsquo;m working on that opens two windows:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/pi-weather-monitor-startup-640.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"41","created":"2016-08-23 14:40:00","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2016-08-23 14:45:32","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2016-08-23 14:40:00","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"4","ordering":"21","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"11251","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"471","asset_id":"616","title":"FatCow Fail","alias":"fatcow-fail","introtext":"<p>I&rsquo;m about done with FatCow. As you may know, I&rsquo;ve been a big fan of FatCow and many, many years now. I&rsquo;ve been a customer for about 15 years and have been recommending their service to anyone I know who needs to host email or web sites. I have multiple accounts with them and even pay an extra fee every month to get higher level support &ndash; mostly just so I could give them more money since I think (thought) they provided such a great product.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, what happened?<\/p>\r\n<h1>False Positive<\/h1>\r\n<p>Well, in order to better protect their customers&rsquo; sites and to help generate additional sales for their SiteLock product offering, FatCow has started performing periodic, free security scans. What&rsquo;s weird is that they&rsquo;re selling SiteLock, but not using SiteLock for the scans. The issue for me is that scanner repeatedly kicks out false positives and its driving me crazy.<\/p>\r\n<p>Let me give you some examples.<\/p>\r\n<p>Every week or so, I receive the same email from the FatCow Security team:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">During a routine scan, the security team at FatCow discovered infected files in your \"account_name\" account. Typically, these security vulnerabilities are due to the presence of an outdated application or script in your account.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">You can view a list of the infected files in the \/stats directory of your account, in a file named 'websitescan.txt.' You can find more information on how to access this file, interpret its contents, and remove infected files in the article below: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fatcow.com\/knowledgebase\/beta\/article.bml?ArticleID=437\">http:\/\/www.fatcow.com\/knowledgebase\/beta\/article.bml?ArticleID=437<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Please make sure to check any file backup(s) you have for a clean copy of the infected files. If you have clean copies, you can upload those. If not, once you get the infected files cleaned or removed, we recommend you keep regular backups of your website going forward<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">However, If you don&rsquo;t feel comfortable removing the infected files yourself, or would like to talk to a security expert, we recommend that you contact our preferred partner, SiteLock. You can find out about their security solutions at https:\/\/www.fatcow.com\/product\/sitelock, or call them directly at 1-855-378-6200.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Finally, to learn more about how to keep your site safe, visit the article below: http:\/\/www.fatcow.com\/knowledgebase\/beta\/article.bml?ArticleID=2324#Nugget_5264 .<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Sincerely,<br \/>The FatCow Team<\/p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s cool, right? Proactive scanning of my site coupled with providing me with all sorts of information about what this means and how to fix it. So, I quickly jumped on my site and looked at the file; here&rsquo;s the contents:<\/p>\r\n<p><samp>Scan started at - Tue Apr 19 14:52:35 EDT 2016<\/samp><br \/><samp>\/home\/log\/admintools_breaches.log.1: EIG.PHP.Backdoor.ArbEval-7.UNOFFICIAL FOUND<\/samp><\/p>\r\n<p><samp>----------- SCAN SUMMARY -----------<\/samp><br \/><samp>Infected files: 1<\/samp><br \/><samp>Time: 751.499 sec (12 m 31 s)<\/samp><br \/><samp>Scan ended at - Tue Apr 19 15:05:07 EDT 2016<\/samp><\/p>\r\n<p>The infected file? It&rsquo;s a log file created by the Akeeba Admin Tools plugin. I use this tool on my Joomla sites to block attacks and, when it recognizes an attack, it blocks the IP address of the attacker then logs the activity to a log file.<\/p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s not an infected file, it&rsquo;s a file containing information describing a thwarted attack, a false positive. So, I&rsquo;m regularly pestered with these alarming emails telling me my site&rsquo;s infected when it&rsquo;s actually not. I want them scanning my site and I&rsquo;m actually paying for the SiteLock service on most of my accounts, but it&rsquo;s really not doing much good for me right now.<\/p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve also gotten these infected file notifications on FatCow&rsquo;s server-generated system log files. They send me a notice telling me to clean up these &lsquo;infected&rsquo; files when the files in question are being generated directly by the server, not by anything I&rsquo;m running. My simple CMS-based sites don&rsquo;t even have access to the folder where these system generated log files are placed, but they&rsquo;re still marking them as being infected when they&rsquo;re not.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, I told the folks at FatCow that they&rsquo;re getting false positives and I get the following response:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Hello,<br \/>Thank you for your reply.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">You have received the message from sitelock saying there are infected files in the account. If you have removed the infected files from the account and if you wish to scan the account again, please let us know. With authentication to the account: You can provide us the authentication of the account by answering security question set in the account: Question removed for security? You can check the security answer by going to: https:\/\/www.fatcow.com\/secureControl\/security-question.html?pid=4059212 .<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Also, we have given below some suggestions to safeguard your website:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">+ generate a strong password combination for account, FTP, database and mailboxes.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">+ scan local computer with good antivirus, antispyware programs and clean bad programs.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">+ keep the software up-to-date with vendors\/developers, and seek their support\/forums for any known vulnerabilities\/fixes\/workarounds available.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">+ upgrade all the applications in your account to the latest version &ndash; this also applies to plugins, themes, modules, etc.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact us, We are available 24x7.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, I&rsquo; haven&rsquo;t removed anything from the site as there&rsquo;s no infected files but let them know about the issue and all the FatCow security team can think of is to let me know that I can have the scan repeated if I email them some additional security information. This conversation so far has been a complete waste of time.<\/p>\r\n<p>Sigh.<\/p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s probably my biggest, long-term issue with FatCow support. They&rsquo;re excellent when you call them, but from an email support standpoint, all support personnel seem to want to do is ignore the actual details of your request and simply respond with boilerplate information that has nothing to do with the initial request.<\/p>\r\n<p>As I wrote this blog post, I got fed up and decided to call their support line to see if I can get them moving on this. Now, remember that I pay a monthly fee for premier support, and I&rsquo;ve been sitting on hold waiting for them to answer for the last 35 minutes (so far) with no response.<\/p>\r\n<p>It gets worse.<\/p>\r\n<h1>Shutdown Account<\/h1>\r\n<p>My sun was a Cub Scout and I helped setup and run my son&rsquo;s Cub Scout Pack web site. We&rsquo;ve both since moved on, but they reach out to me every once in a while, when they&rsquo;re having a problem. At one point, FatCow shut down the site and, because it&rsquo;s a volunteer organization running it, nobody noticed the email from FatCow explaining why they did it. That&rsquo;s not good.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, I logged into the pack&rsquo;s FatCow account and found the following:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Hello,<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">This message is to inform you that we have detected spam emails originating from a script in your account. Our monitoring tools have suspected the following file:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\/home\/administrator\/index.php<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">As a result, we had to suspend your account, to avoid problems for site visitors or other customers. If this is your script, then you will need to take necessary action to remove or limit the script's usage to the following:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">200 messages per hour<br \/>2000 messages per day<br \/>100 recipients per execution<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Once you have taken the necessary action, please reply back to us with the confirmation. I suggest you to use bulk mailer service for emailing purpose. You can use Constant Contact to send out emails. To learn more about this, please refer the URL http:\/\/www.fatcow.com\/product\/constantcontact.bml .<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">If this is not your script, it suggests that your account has been compromised. To learn more about reasons for account getting hacked and the ways to prevent it, please visit the KB link: http:\/\/www.fatcow.com\/knowledgebase\/beta\/article.bml?ArticleID=2324#Nugget_5264 .<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">In order to re-enable the account, we ask you or your administrator reply to this message after taking necessary action on the script specified above.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Sincerely,<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Ganesh P<br \/>Senior Technical Specialist<\/p>\r\n<p>Um, yeah, we&rsquo;re not sending spam, I&rsquo;m sure of it. So I responded and told them we were not sending spam and that they needed to unlock the account. Here&rsquo;s what they said:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">I can understand your concern.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Please download 'logs.txt' file which is inside 'stats' folder from Filemanager tool which will show logs of email sending from script \/administrator\/index.php. If you analyze this mail log, you can notice email sending to webmaster@sitename.org with subject 'Automatic_IP_blocking_notification_for' . This seems like issue with configuration settings inside Joomla admin panel.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">I have now removed suspension on wbsite and CGI service for your account. Please log in to admin panel of website at http:\/\/sitename.org\/administrator\/ and recheck the configuration settings.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Thank you for clarification about Joomla module. Our server monitoring tool taken it as a suspicious activity and thus suspended services for your account. However, we have revoked the suspension on your account. In any case if you are exceeding the email limits, it will take it as spamming. This is the reason we are suspending the services for your account.<\/p>\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s wild about this is that in their response, they actually provide the proof that the server isn&rsquo;t sending spam. By their very words, they&rsquo;re describing that the server is sending out emails notifying the webmaster that someone is trying to break into the site. Automated threat detection systems are great, but in this case, automatically shutting down the site was a really bad idea.<\/p>\r\n<p>What I&rsquo;d like to see is them trying to actually block the hackers from trying to get into my site rather than shutting down my site because they think my server&rsquo;s sending spam in response to the attack.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, I took a look at the admin tools console and noticed the following:<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/website-login-surge-640.png\" alt=\"Website login surge\" height=\"603\" width=\"640\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>As you can see from the figure, the server was humming along, then suddenly had more than 8,000 bad login attempts in a very short period of time. This site has a maximum of about 100 users, no more than 10 or so would ever be on the site at the same time, so clearly there&rsquo;s a problem. Does my hosting account need to be shut down because of it? No, not really. Are the hackers getting in? Nope, they&rsquo;re not, and each IP address is being blocked, so they have to come up with a new one to try again. Clearly there&rsquo;s a botnet at work here.<\/p>\r\n<p>FatCow&rsquo;s made some serious changes to their support policies. Where I could create a new support ticket or call them any time I wanted, they&rsquo;ve since removed those abilities and force everyone to have an online chat first. What&rsquo;s funny is the content to submit a ticket and the phone number are still on the support page, they simply hide them after the page renders in order to force you through the chat process. Chat doesn&rsquo;t work very well when there&rsquo;s a long wait. The first time I tried it, the hold time was like 20 minutes, so I got to work on something else as I waited. A technician finally got on the chat, but I&rsquo;d forgotten that I&rsquo;d started a chat and couldn&rsquo;t figure out what that chiming was from my PC.<\/p>\r\n<h1>Making Some Progress<\/h1>\r\n<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve been pretty vocal with FatCow about this issue, every week, when they send me an infection notice, I sometimes politely, but sometimes not so politely let them know it&rsquo;s a false positive. When they send the notification, FatCow also notifies SiteLock, so their folks quickly call me trying to sell me more services. I&rsquo;ve discussed this with SiteLock, and that&rsquo;s how I know it&rsquo;s the FatCow malware scanner, not SiteLock&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s causing the false positive.<\/p>\r\n<p>Eventually, my rants were escalated, and a senior technician jumped in and is trying to help. Apparently, they won&rsquo;t change their scanner to identify this particular false positive. They say that it can&rsquo;t be done, but as an experienced software developer I&rsquo;m having a hard time believing that. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s an investment thing, WordPress is more popular than Joomla, so I imagine they have more customers on WordPress than any other. I&rsquo;ve proven this actually as I have an equal number of WordPress and Joomla sites, and their scanners only find issues with WordPress sites.<\/p>\r\n<p>The final solution? They simply let their support technicians know not to send me a malware notification if it&rsquo;s that one file. It works for me, but that&rsquo;s not really the best solution. At least they&rsquo;re trying (finally) and at least they&rsquo;re proactively scanning their sites for malware.<\/p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m going to stick with FatCow for now, but the more I work with them, the more I realize that I really need a different solution. Stay tuned.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2016-09-22 15:53:01","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2016-09-22 16:06:53","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2016-09-22 15:53:01","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/2016\\\/fail.jpg\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/2016\\\/fail.jpg\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"4","ordering":"146","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"8741","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

I presented at the conference last year and I really enjoyed the event; lots of interesting topics, lots of interesting people. I delivered a session on Apache Cordova and got to spend some time with other Cordova enthusiasts like my colleague Carlos Santana (NOT the guitarist you&rsquo;re thinking of).<\/p>\r\n<p>This year, I&rsquo;m still talking about Apache Cordova, but I&rsquo;m also going to spend some time talking about JavaScript-driven Native frameworks like NativeScript and React native plus Microsoft&rsquo;s Xamarin platform. Here&rsquo;s my abstract for this year&rsquo;s talk:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\"There&rsquo;s a lot of ways to deliver mobile apps: native, web, commercial mobile app development platforms, and more. In between those options are popular open source projects that provide robust, alternative approaches. In this session, you&rsquo;ll learn about the venerable Apache Cordova project, the project that defined the hybrid mobile development approach, plus new upstarts like Telerik&rsquo;s NativeScript, Facebook&rsquo;s React Native and Microsoft&rsquo;s Xamarin that take hybrid to the next level, giving developers the ability to create compelling, performant native apps using JavaScript or other languages. Expect a fast-paced, high-energy session with lots of content as John Wargo introduces you to a different way to do mobile using open source tools.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>I look forward to seeing you there!<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2016-09-26 21:02:44","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2016-09-26 21:04:46","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2016-09-26 21:02:44","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/common\\\/Fotolia_96944434_XS.jpg\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/common\\\/Fotolia_96944434_XS.jpg\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"3","ordering":"147","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"6627","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"473","asset_id":"619","title":"Raspberry Pi Reminder Project","alias":"raspberry-pi-reminder-project","introtext":"<p>Note, this article was originally published as <em>Get a Flashing Meeting Reminder with a Raspberry Pi<\/em> online at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/makezine.com\/projects\/get-a-flashing-meeting-reminder-with-a-raspberry-pi\/\" rel=\"noopener\">Make Magazine<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<h1>Introduction<\/h1>\r\n<p>I work at home and I spend a lot of time on the phone talking to clients and vendors. My employer uses Google Apps (which includes Google Calendar and Gmail) and the appointment notification capabilities of both are not very robust. Well, they’re robust, but not enough to get my attention when I’m distracted. What I find is that I often miss the notification when I’m busy doing something else or I notice the notification, but quickly forget about just a few minutes later and ultimately miss some meetings or join late.<\/p>\r\n<p>One day, after being 15 minutes for a meeting, I decided I had to fix this problem. I needed a more effective way to alert myself of upcoming appointments. As I spend a lot of time on the phone, I didn’t want an audible alert, so I decided I’d do something visual. While browsing the Adafruit web site, I noticed the Pimoroni Unicorn HAT (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/shop.pimoroni.com\/products\/unicorn-hat\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/shop.pimoroni.com\/products\/unicorn-hat<\/a>) and that had me thinking of solution. The Unicorn HAT is an add-on board for the Raspberry Pi that consists of an 8x8 array (that’s 64 total if you’re counting) of bright RGB LEDs. What if I wrote a Raspberry Pi application that connected to Google Calendar and checked my calendar for my next appointment then flashed those 64 LEDs to let me know? As long as I was awake and in the room, I’d likely see the alert and decrease my chances of missing an appointment.<\/p>\r\n<p>Well, that’s what I did and I’ll show you how to do it too. You can see the final project in action at <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/X111pAaEP-k\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/X111pAaEP-k<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>I ordered a Unicorn HAT then grabbed a Pi I had lying around and started writing code. The app for this project is written in Python, and is the first Python code I’ve written, so be gentle with me; you can find the code at <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/pi-remind\">https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/pi-remind<\/a>. The code checks the calendar every minute for appointments that start within the next 10 minutes. If there’s an appointment starting between 10 and 5 minutes from now, the lights will all flash white for a second or so. Between 5 and 2 minutes, the lights will all flash yellow twice. At less than two minutes until the appointment start, the lights will swirl in a multi-color splash. I’ll describe how to more interesting things with the lights at the end of the article.<\/p>\r\n<p>The hardware for the project is pretty simple, all you need is a Pi, the Unicorn HAT, a power supply and a case for the Pi. You should be able to acquire the parts for less than $70US and assemble it all in just a few minutes.<\/p>\r\n<h1>Components<\/h1>\r\n<p>For this project, I used the following components:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.raspberrypi.org\" rel=\"noopener\">Raspberry Pi<\/a>. The Pimoroni Unicorn HAT supports Raspberry Pi models 3, 2, B+, and A+, so you’ll have to pick one of them. For this project I used a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B.<\/li>\r\n<li>Micro SD memory card (4 GB or higher) to hold Raspbian, the Raspberry Pi OS (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.raspberrypi.org\/downloads\/raspbian\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/www.raspberrypi.org\/downloads\/raspbian<\/a>\/).<\/li>\r\n<li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/shop.pimoroni.com\/products\/unicorn-hat\" rel=\"noopener\">Pimoroni Unicorn HAT<\/a>. I purchased mine from Adafruit (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/2288\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/2288<\/a>).<\/li>\r\n<li>Raspberry Pi Power Supply. Any Pi compatible power supply will work, I used the CanaKit 5V 2.5A Raspberry Pi 3 Power Supply \/ Adapter \/ Charger (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/CanaKit-Raspberry-Supply-Adapter-Charger\/dp\/B00MARDJZ4\" rel=\"noopener\">http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/CanaKit-Raspberry-Supply-Adapter-Charger\/dp\/B00MARDJZ4<\/a>).<\/li>\r\n<li>Raspberry Pi case. Again, you can use whatever case you want, I selected the Adafruit Raspberry Pi B+ \/ Pi 2 \/ Pi 3 Case - Smoke Base - w\/ Clear Top (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/2258\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/2258<\/a>). I picked this one because it had a clear front, so the lights would show clearly even with the top on, and because it looked cool.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h1>Assembling the Hardware<\/h1>\r\n<p>Figure 1 shows the parts I used for this project (minus the power supply). The Unicorn HAT on the left is facing down so you can easily see the female headers on the back of the board that match the male Pi’s GPIO headers.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/pi-reminder-01_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1 – Project Parts Ready For Assembly<\/p>\r\n<p>Flip the Unicorn HAT over and align the GPIO Pins with the female header socket on the HAT as shown in Figure 2<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/pi-reminder-02_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2 – Unicorn HAT Connected to the Raspberry Pi<\/p>\r\n<p>With the HAT properly positioned, push down gently to seat the board securely on the Raspberry Pi as shown in Figure 3.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/pi-reminder-03_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 3 – Completed HAT installation<\/p>\r\n<p>Right now, the HAT is floating free over the Pi, connected only through the header pins. Since the whole contraption will be sealed in a case, I didn’t feel the need to mount the HAT any more securely, but you may want to. Adafruit sells a set of spacers (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/2336\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/2336<\/a>) you can use to secure the other side of the HAT against the Pi.<\/p>\r\n<p>Next, install the Pi and HAT in the case as shown in Figure 4, then attach the cover (not shown).<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/pi-reminder-04_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 4 – Installing the Project Components in the Case<\/p>\r\n<p>At this point, the hardware is all installed and ready to go. When finished, the Pi will only need network and power connections, but for the remainder of the setup process, you’re going to need a display (monitor), keyboard, and mouse. Connect those components to the Pi as shown in Figure 5. Don’t connect power, you have some more work to do before you can do that.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/pi-reminder-05_1.png\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 5 – Hardware Installation Completed<\/p>\r\n<h1>Setting Up the Raspberry Pi<\/h1>\r\n<p>The Raspberry PI needs an OS to boot, so grab Micro SD card then follow the instructions at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.raspberrypi.org\/documentation\/installation\/installing-images\/README.md\">https:\/\/www.raspberrypi.org\/documentation\/installation\/installing-images\/README.md<\/a> to download and install the OS on the SD card. Once that’s completed, insert the SD card in the Pi.<\/p>\r\n<p>At this point, you’re ready to power up the Pi. Turn on your monitor then plug the power supply into a power outlet and the Micro USB port on the Pi (upper right corner of the Pi shown in Figure 5). You have a few steps to perform. The first step is to configure some system-wide settings on the Raspberry Pi. You could get away without doing this, but you may run into problems later if you don’t compete these steps. To start, open the Raspberry menu in the upper left corner of the Pi screen. In the menu that appears, select Preferences then select Raspberry Pi Configuration as shown in Figure 6.<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/pi-reminder-06_1.png\" width=\"639\" height=\"662\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 6 – Opening the Raspberry Pi Configuration Utility<\/p>\r\n<p>By default, the default Raspbian image only utilizes a part of the SD card’s storage (3 GB); if the SD Card you used for your Raspbian installation is larger than 3 GB, you’ll need to expand the file system to use the whole disk. If you don’t do this, your Pi’s storage system may not have enough room to install of the additional software this project utilizes. (editor note: It seems like later versions of Raspbian do this automatically, but you’d better check).<\/p>\r\n<p>In the Raspberry Pi Configuration utility shown in Figure 7, click the Expand Filesytem button to enable the Pi to use the whole SD card for storage. Making this change will require rebooting your Pi, so don’t be surprised when you’re prompted to do so.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you want, use this opportunity to change the host name for the Pi device. In Figure 7 you can see that I’ve named mine pi_remind so I can easily find the device on the network later. If you’re a UK-based reader, you’re done, click the OK button and let the Pi reboot. The Pi comes pre-configured for UK keyboard and other locale settings, so you’re good to go.<\/p>\r\n<p>As a US-based hacker, I find that the default settings don’t work for me. Switch to the Localisation tab and check all of the settings exposed there to ensure its properly configured for your locale, time zone and keyboard settings. Click the OK button when you’re done to save your changes. Don’t be surprised if you’re prompted to reboot the Pi.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/pi-reminder-07_1.png\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 7 – Raspberry Pi Configuration Utility<\/p>\r\n<p>Next you’ll need to update the Pi’s core software and install some additional software needed to communicate with the Unicorn HAT and Google Calendar.<\/p>\r\n<p>After the Pi reboots, open a terminal window and issue the following command:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>sudo apt-get update<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>This command will update the Pi’s local repository of software update repositories. When the command completes, issue the following command in the same terminal window:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>sudo apt-get upgrade<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>This updates the Raspbian OS and associated programs to the latest version. This process will take quite a while, but the benefit is that at the end of the process, your Pi is running the latest and greatest supported version of all apps and code for the device.<\/p>\r\n<p>Note: When it comes to writing code, the Raspberry Pi is too slow and the available screen resolution is too small for me to work effectively. For that reason, I prefer to code on my desktop and upload the code to the Pi for testing. I coded the Python app for this project using the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.jetbrains.com\/pycharm\" rel=\"noopener\">PyCharm IDE<\/a>. The commercial version of the IDE enables me to remotely deploy the app to the pi device; you can read how I did it here: <a href=\"http:\/\/johnwargo.com\/index.php\/microcontrollers-single-board-computers\/webstorm-development-on-the-raspberry-pi.html\">http:\/\/johnwargo.com\/index.php\/microcontrollers-single-board-computers\/webstorm-development-on-the-raspberry-pi.html<\/a>. In order to be able to push code updates to the Pi, you’ll need to figure out the Pi’s IP address, the referenced article has instructions on how to do so. To simplify this on your home network, you may want to set a static IP address on the Pi so the IP address won’t change if you switch routers or network providers.<\/p>\r\n<h1>Installing Required Python Modules<\/h1>\r\n<p>The Unicorn HAT uses its own python libraries; details can be found on the Pimoroni web site at http:\/\/learn.pimoroni.com\/tutorial\/unicorn-hat\/getting-started-with-unicorn-hat. To install the libraries on the Pi, open a terminal window and execute the following command:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>sudo curl -sS get.pimoroni.com\/unicornhat | bash<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>During installation, you’ll be asked whether you want to also install sample code and additional software; this project doesn’t make use of any of them, but you can install them just to see what else they give you.<\/p>\r\n<p>Next, you’ll need to install the Google Calendar API client code. You can find complete instructions at <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/api-client-library\/python\/start\/installation\">https:\/\/developers.google.com\/api-client-library\/python\/start\/installation<\/a>. Basically just open a terminal window and execute the following command:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>sudo pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client python-dateutil pytz<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>Finally, there’s a set of scientific libraries that are used in some of the Unicorn HAT code in the project, so you will need to install them using the following command:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>sudo apt-get install python-numpy<\/code><\/p>\r\n<h1>Downloading the Project’s Code<\/h1>\r\n<p>The project’s Python source code is available at https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/pi_remind. You can clone the files using Git or download the files using a browser then extract the files to a folder on the Pi’s file system. When I setup the project for the first time, I opened a new terminal window (to make sure I was pointing to the pi user’s home folder) and executed the following commands:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>mkdir pi_remind<br \/>cd pi_remind<br \/>wget https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/pi_remind\/archive\/master.zip<br \/>unzip -j master.zip<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>This creates a folder for the project’s code then pulls down the files and extracts the files to the folder. When everything finishes, you should see a file called remind.py (along with some other files) in the folder. Make note of the folder location you used for the project files, you’ll need the folder path later.<\/p>\r\n<p>Configuring Access to Google Calendar<\/p>\r\n<p>Before the project’s software can access your Google Calendar, you need to setup a developer account with Google (if you don’t already have one) and define an application in the Google Developer Console that makes use of the Google Calendar APIs. Start by opening a browser window and navigating to <a href=\"https:\/\/console.developers.google.com\">https:\/\/console.developers.google.com<\/a>. Login or create an account then look for the developer console shown in Figure 8.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/pi-reminder-08_1.png\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 8 – Google API Developer Console<\/p>\r\n<p>Click the link for Calendar API highlighted in the figure and Enable the API then define an application for this project. Once that’s done, you’ll need to create credentials for your project as shown in Figure 9.<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/pi-reminder-09_1.png\" width=\"638\" height=\"297\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 9 – Google API Application Credentials<\/p>\r\n<p>Once your credentials are ready, click the Download JSON button highlighted in the figure. Download the file to the folder where you extracted the python project files in the previous section (in my example, it’s the pi user’s home folder in a subfolder called pi_remind (\/home\/pi\/pi_remind). When you save the file, Google will automatically assign a long file name including the unique identifier for the project. For this project, save the file with the file name client_secret.json.<\/p>\r\n<p>With the client secret file in place, you’ll have to authorize the Pi to access your calendar. Open a terminal window, navigate to the folder where you extracted the project files and issue the following command:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>sudo python .\/remind.py<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>Using the folder example from earlier, you would issue the following commands:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>cd pi_remind<\/code><br \/><code>sudo python .\/remind.py<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>If everything is setup correctly, the python code will execute and show a screen similar to the one shown in Figure 10.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/pi-reminder-10_1.png\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 10 – Executing the Reminder Code for the First Time<\/p>\r\n<p>At this point, the application will open the default browser and display the page shown in Figure 11.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/pi-reminder-11_1.png\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 11 – Google Account Login Page<\/p>\r\n<p>Login to your Google account and click the Next button. If you’re like me, you probably have multiple Google accounts, so be sure to provide the email address for your primary Google Calendar account.<\/p>\r\n<p>After you provide your password, the browser will prompt you to authorize the project’s Python application to access your calendar as shown in Figure 12. The application name, Pi Reminder in this case, will be the same one you created in the Google Developer Console just a few steps back.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/pi-reminder-12_1.png\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 12 – Google Calendar API Authorization<\/p>\r\n<p>After you complete the authentication process, the browser will display a page similar to the one shown in Figure 13. At this point you can close the browser window.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/pi-reminder-13_1.png\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 13 – Completed Google Calendar Authorization<\/p>\r\n<p>The python application may quit after the authentication process completes, so you may have to restart the python application by executing the following command:<br \/>sudo python .\/remind.py<\/p>\r\n<p>The easiest way to execute the command again is to simply press the keyboard’s up arrow key and the previous command should pop onto the command line for you to execute.<\/p>\r\n<p>At this point, the application should connect to the authorized calendar and start checking for appointments as shown in Figure 14. To see a video of the app in action, see: <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/X111pAaEP-k\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/X111pAaEP-k<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2016\/pi-reminder-14_1.png\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 14 – Pi Reminder Checking for Appointments<\/p>\r\n<h1>Configuring Auto Startup<\/h1>\r\n<p>There are a few steps you must complete to configure the Raspberry Pi so it executes the the remind app on startup. You can read more about this here: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/johnwargo.com\/index.php\/microcontrollers-single-board-computers\/autostart-python-app-on-raspberry-pi-in-a-terminal-window.html\" rel=\"noopener\">Autostart Python App on Raspberry Pi in a Terminal Window<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>Note: Don't forget to authorize the Google Calendar API to access your Google Calendar by running the manual startup process described in the previous session before enabling autostart.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you don't already have a terminal window open, open one then navigate to the folder where you extracted the project files. Make the project's bash script files executable by executing the following command:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>chmod +x start-remind.sh<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>Next, you'll need to open the pi user's session autostart file using the following command:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>sudo nano ~\/.config\/lxsession\/LXDE-pi\/autostart<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>Add the following lines to the end (bottom) of the file:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>@lxterminal -e \/home\/pi\/pi_remind\/start-remind.sh<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>To save your changes, press ctrl-o then press the Enter key. Next, press ctrl-x to exit the nano application.<\/p>\r\n<p>Reboot the Raspberry Pi; when it restarts, the python remind process should execute in its own terminal window.<\/p>\r\n<p>Another option is to copy the project’s start-remind.desktop file to~\/.config\/autostart. Reboot the Pi and you should see a terminal window running the Reminder app.<\/p>\r\n<h1>Customizing the Python Application<\/h1>\r\n<p>Now, when implementing this, I just used a simple flashing pattern that lit all of the LEDs using a single color. That’s not very exciting as you’ll likely see when you get this project up and running. The Unicorn HAT sample Python code found at https:\/\/github.com\/pimoroni\/unicorn-hat\/tree\/master\/python\/examples has code you can switch into the app in order to make the lights flash more interestingly.<\/p>\r\n<p>Right now, the code is as simple as I could make it. When the Pi checks for calendar entries, it doesn’t check to see if the appointment has a reminder set. For some placeholder appointments or less important appointments, you might not want to be reminded. So, one enhancement I plan on making is to check the appointment to see if I need alerting. Perhaps I’ll code that and add it to the project on GitHub.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"41","created":"2016-09-29 00:01:44","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2018-12-21 13:04:32","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2016-09-29 12:33:46","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/2016\\\/pi-reminder-in-stand-cropped-640.png\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/2016\\\/pi-reminder-in-stand-cropped-640.png\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"14","ordering":"31","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"10219","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

The hardware measures weather values (temperature, humidity and pressure) using the Astro Pi Sense HAT then uploads the data to a Weather Underground weather station. The Sense HAT board includes instruments that measure temperature, humidity and barometric pressure plus an 8x8 LED display, a joystick, and an accelerometer.<\/p>\r\n<p>The HAT was created by the folks at <a href=\"https:\/\/astro-pi.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Astro Pi<\/a>; elementary school children were solicited to create experiments using the Sense HAT it that would be executed on the International Space Station. Eventually, many experiments were selected and an astronaut performed them and sent back the results for analysis. I read different articles about this board, so I decided to create a project using it.

{"id":"477","asset_id":"623","title":"Tooling Changes","alias":"tooling-changes","introtext":"<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing some different work lately; building and writing about some IoT projects, writing some whitepapers, working on some documentation for Microsoft, and writing a bunch of code (Ionic, TypeScript, and more). I noticed that I&rsquo;ve been spending a lot of time lately with some tools I&rsquo;ve not used much lately. I thought I&rsquo;d write about it here.<\/p>\r\n<h1>Markdown &amp; MarkdownPad<\/h1>\r\n<p>All of the IoT tutorial work I&rsquo;ve done recently for AT&amp;T, and all of the documentation work I&rsquo;m doing for Micosoft have been in markdown(<a href=\"https:\/\/daringfireball.net\/projects\/markdown\/\">https:\/\/daringfireball.net\/projects\/markdown\/<\/a>). I remember when I first encountered an .md file, it was in the readme files for the Apache Cordova team. I did some searching online and couldn&rsquo;t find anything about the file extension, so I had to ask the Cordova dev team what it was. I haven&rsquo;t found a good markdown editor on the Mac, but I&rsquo;m a huge fan of MarkdownPad (<a href=\"http:\/\/markdownpad.com\/\">http:\/\/markdownpad.com\/<\/a>) although it seems to have been abandoned by its author &ndash; the last update was in 2013. That&rsquo;s unfortunate as it&rsquo;s the best, and most professionally produced, markdown editor I&rsquo;ve found for Windows.<\/p>\r\n<p>The biggest requirement for me is to be able to view the markdown alongside the output, so I can clearly see how my work will be formatted online. MarkdownPad does this for me, other Windows editors I&rsquo;ve used (Visual Studio Code, JetBrains WebStorm, and many others) simply don&rsquo;t do that.<\/p>\r\n<p>When I started working for AT&amp;T and Microsoft, it was the first time I&rsquo;d worked with markdown files with embedded image files &ndash; I quickly learned that MarkdownPad doesn&rsquo;t deal with that very well &ndash; the two sides of the editor window (code and output) don&rsquo;t stay in sync when you&rsquo;re linking in images into your files. MarkdownPad is also not compatible with Windows 10, you have to install some extra software to get it to work, and even that&rsquo;s buggy. That&rsquo;s too bad, I wish Evan Wondrasek would update his app.<\/p>\r\n<h1>Git<\/h1>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;d used git and github before, mostly for managing my own code and accessing others. My work at AT&amp;T and Microsoft have forced me to actively interact with others in multiple code repositories, so I&rsquo;ve gotten more experience with it. I&rsquo;ve even become a more frequent user of git integration in WebStorm, PyCharm, Visual Studio Code and more. I haven&rsquo;t yet had to recover from some shoddy coding, but integrating Git into my development workflow has made me more confident.<\/p>\r\n<h1>Visual Studio Code<\/h1>\r\n<p>I became a big fan of WebStorm when I learned it had Apache Cordova support, and I wrote a bunch of code using the IDE. I even adopted PyCharm (a Python IDE from the same codebase) when I taught myself Python this year. At Microsoft, I&rsquo;ve started using Visual Studio Code for all of my typescript and Ionic coding. It&rsquo;s a really great IDE, and, with all of its available plugins, it&rsquo;s very capable. I want to use Visual Studio for my Ionic coding, mostly because of the testing and debugging capabilities Visual Studio Tools for Apache Cordova gives me, but the lack of a terminal window in Visual Studio forces me to leave Visual Studio to use the Ionic CLI to add pages, providers and so on. This isn&rsquo;t a big deal, and I expect I&rsquo;ll spend more time in Visual Studio than Visual Studio Code going foreward. I&rsquo;m still pretty impressed with what Code provides, how often Microsoft updates it, and how many cool plugins are available. It&rsquo;s going to be fun to see what happens with this tool over the next 18 months.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2016-12-19 00:39:59","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2016-12-19 00:39:59","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2016-12-19 00:39:59","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"1","ordering":"35","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"7131","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

Basically you place two strings of battery-powered LEDs into a glass jar and use a microcontroller to fade one strand up while the other strand fades down. The fade up\/down process repeats for as long as the microcontroller has power. You could even add 1 or more strands of lights to the project if you want.<\/p>\r\n<p>When I discovered the project, I thought it was really cool, but they threw a lot of hardware (a Raspberry Pi, two HATS and a battery) into the solution, so I wanted to see if I could build something with less parts and for less money.

A PDF version of this article is available in the Attachments section (at the very bottom of the article).<\/p>\r\n<h1>Hardware Components<\/h1>\r\n<p>The project (as I've implemented it) uses the following required hardware:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Adafruit Pro Trinket - 3V 12MHz (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/2010\">https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/2010<\/a>).<\/li>\r\n<li>Adafruit Pro Trinket LiIon\/LiPoly Backpack Add-On (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/2124\">https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/2124<\/a>).<\/li>\r\n<li>Lithium Ion Polymer Battery - 3.7v 500mAh (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/1578\">https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/1578<\/a>).<\/li>\r\n<li>Toggle switch; all you need is a SPST switch, but I used a SPDT switch I had lying around.<\/li>\r\n<li>A couple inches of 22 or 24 ga stranded wire.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>If you chose to use a different microcontroller, you can replace the Adafruit Pro Trinket LiIon\/LiPoly Backpack Add-On, which is purpose built for the Adafruit Pro Trinket, with the USB LiIon\/LiPoly charger - v1.2 (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/259\">https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/259<\/a>).<\/p>\r\n<p>For the white LED version, I used the following hardware:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Ikea ENSIDIG Glass Jar (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ikea.com\/us\/en\/catalog\/products\/10239888\">http:\/\/www.ikea.com\/us\/en\/catalog\/products\/10239888<\/a>).<\/li>\r\n<li>2 Ikea SÄRDAL LED light chain with 12 lights (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ikea.com\/us\/en\/catalog\/products\/60277514\">http:\/\/www.ikea.com\/us\/en\/catalog\/products\/60277514<\/a>).<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>For the Christmas version, I used the following hardware:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Small Mason jar<\/li>\r\n<li>Wire Light LED Strand - 12 Green LEDs + Coin Cell Holder (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/896\">https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/896<\/a>).<\/li>\r\n<li>Wire Light LED Strand - 12 Red LEDs + Coin Cell Holder (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/897\">https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/897<\/a>).<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>The LED strand is smaller for the Christmas version, so I used a smaller jar. A benefit of the mason jar is that you can mount the hardware to the underside of the lid, which makes it easier to turn on\/off and charge.<\/p>\r\n<h1>Hardware Assembly<\/h1>\r\n<p>Start by assembling the Adafruit Pro Trinket LiIon\/LiPoly Backpack Add-On. To enable the use of a SPST switch to power on\/off the board, cut the trace connecting the two holes highlighted in the following figure. This disconnects the board’s power output, but once you connect a switch between those two holes, you’ll be able to control power to the Trinket board.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/arduino-twinkle-lights-figure-02.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2 - Adafruit Pro Trinket LiIon\/LiPoly Backpack Add-On Board<\/p>\r\n<p>Solder the included headers to the Adafruit Pro Trinket LiIon\/LiPoly Backpack Add-On. The header pins connect to the three holes in the lower-left corner of the board as shown in the previous figure. Insert the headers through the board from the bottom (the figure shows the board from a top view) and the black plastic part of the header is flush against the bottom of the board. The easiest way to do this is to insert the header pins in a breadboard, then mount the board on top for soldering as shown in the figure.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/arduino-twinkle-lights-figure-03.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 3 – Soldering the Header Pins to the Battery Charger<\/p>\r\n<p>Cut two short lengths of wire, then strip the ends and solder an end of each wire to the switch.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/arduino-twinkle-lights-figure-04.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 4 – Battery Charger and Switch<\/p>\r\n<p>Finally, solder the open wire ends to the switch holes (highlighted in red in Figure 2. Since the hardware will be bumped around in the glass jar, I placed shrink tubing around the solder connections to protect them from being shorted out.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/arduino-twinkle-lights-figure-05.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 5 Battery Charger Connected to the Switch<\/p>\r\n<p>Solder the Adafruit Pro Trinket LiIon\/LiPoly Backpack Add-On onto the Arduino Pro Trinket 3V.

Each comes with a battery pack and switch, but since we’re driving them from the Trinket, you won’t need those parts.<\/p>\r\n<p>For the Adafruit color LEDs, use a Philips screwdriver to remove the screws from the battery case and open the case. The LED strand connects to the switch and battery contacts as shown in the figure. Make note of which wires are connected to the battery's positive (+) and negative (-) terminals. In my case, the contact in the lower battery slot connects to the battery’s positive (+) terminal and the one at the top connects to the negative (-) terminal.

In the strands I had, the positive wire was coated with a white stripe, so it was easy for me to tell the difference between the two wires (without knotting one of them).<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/arduino-twinkle-lights-figure-08.png\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 8 – Colored LED Strand<\/p>\r\n<p>For the SÄRDAL LED light chain units, use a Philips screwdriver to remove the screws from both the top and bottom of the battery case. The LED strand connects to a circuit board inside the battery case, make note of which wires are connected to the battery's positive (+) and negative (-) terminals. As you can see from the following figure, the board is labeled with + and – symbols, so it’s easy to tell which wire is which. Tie a simple knot in the negative (-) wire– that way, when you’re soldering the wires to the board in the next step, you’ll be able to tell which is which.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/arduino-twinkle-lights-figure-09.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 9 – White LED Strand Battery Unit<\/p>\r\n<p>Optional: To protect the LED circuit, solder a small resistor (in my measurements, the existing white battery pack used a 2.5 Ohm resistor) to each strand's positive (+) wire. I grabbed some 47 Ohm resistors I had lying around to use for this. Be sure to use shrink tubing to cover the open wire and resistor to keep it from shorting out the circuit.<\/p>\r\n<p>Solder the wires from the LED strands to the appropriate pins on the Arduino Pro Trinket board. For each strand, solder the strand's negative (-) wire to the two GROUND pins in the lower-left corner of Figure 6. Solder each strand's positive (+) wire to pins 9 and 10 in the upper-left corner of the figure. Solder the wires from one strand to pin 9 and the wire from the other strand to pin 10.<\/p>\r\n<p>NOTE: The picture isn't acurate, when I built this unit, I soldered the wires to the WRONG HOLES. I've since fixed this, and need to take a new photo for here.

You can find complete directions on how to setup your development environment and deploy compiled code to the Trinket in the Trinket tutorial (<a href=\"https:\/\/learn.adafruit.com\/introducing-pro-trinket\/overview\">https:\/\/learn.adafruit.com\/introducing-pro-trinket\/overview<\/a>).<\/p>\r\n<p>Stuff the whole contraption into the jar, turn it on, and close the lid. You're done!<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/arduino-twinkle-lights-figure-11.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 11 – The Christmas Version of the Project in Action<\/p>\r\n<h1>Mounting<\/h1>\r\n<p>For the white lights, the strand is so long and the lights so large, that stuffing the whole contraption in a jar works quite well. The hardware just sits at the bottom of the jar and is hardly noticed, especially in darker rooms. To charge the battery, or flip the switch, you’d have to pull the whole assembly out of the jar and put it back when you’re done.<\/p>\r\n<p>In Figure 11, the lights are rather small and the strand short, so the hardware stands out more prominently. The mason jar implementation provides an interesting option for mounting the hardware. I drilled some holes in the lid, and using two standoffs and screws, mounted the hardware to the underside of the lid. I then used two-sided tape to adhere the battery to the lid, underneath the microcontroller (see Figure 12). With this approach, you simply remove the top to charge the battery or flip the switch, reducing stress on the assembly.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/arduino-twinkle-lights-figure-12.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 12 – Mounting the Hardware to the Mason Jar Lid<\/p>\r\n<h1>The Project’s Code<\/h1>\r\n<p>The project’s code is pretty simple. At the beginning, you’ll find code that initializes the variables used by the application:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>\/\/Analog output pin assignments<\/code> <code>const int pin0 = 9;<\/code> <code>const int pin1 = 10;<\/code> <code>\/\/Specifies how long the application delays between changes to output voltage<\/code> <code>const int delayVal = 10; \/\/in milliseconds<\/code> <code>\/\/Used to track which pin is going up and which down<\/code> <code>int upPin, downPin;<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>If you connect the LED strand’s positive wires to different Trinket Analog output pins, you’ll need to change the values assigned to pin0 and pin1.<\/p>\r\n<p>Right now, the application powers the LED strands from 0 to 255 as the strand brightens, and from 255 to 0 as the strand darkens. As each voltage value is assigned to the output pin, the application delays for <code>delayVal<\/code>milliseconds. So, to make the strands fade more quickly, reduce the number assigned to this variable. To make the strands fade more slowly, increase the value assigned to this variable.<\/p>\r\n<p>The <code>setup<\/code>method initializes the variables the application uses to track which strand (by its output pin number) is brightening and which is darkening. Since we’re just starting, and both strands are dark, the code starts by fading <code>pin1<\/code>up to maximum output voltage. Once it’s done, everything is initialized and its time to start flipping both strands.<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>void setup() {<\/code> <code>\/\/Initialize the up and down pin designators<\/code> <code>upPin = pin1;<\/code> <code>downPin = pin0;<\/code> <code>\/\/The setup function initializes the application<\/code> <code>\/\/In this case, we'll just start by winding strand 1 up to<\/code> <code>\/\/full illumination<\/code> <code>for (int i = 0; i &lt;= maxAnalog; i++) {<\/code> <code>&nbsp;&nbsp; \/\/Write the voltage value<\/code> <code>&nbsp;&nbsp; analogWrite(upPin, i);<\/code> <code>&nbsp;&nbsp; \/\/Pause for a little while<\/code> <code>&nbsp;&nbsp; delay(delayVal);<\/code> <code>}<\/code> <code>\/\/Wait a second before continuing<\/code> <code>delay(1000);<\/code> <code>}<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>The <code>loop<\/code>method flips the up and down pin variables (<code>upPin<\/code>and <code>downPin<\/code>), then fades the strand connected to <code>upPin<\/code>up to maximum voltage while simultaneously fading the strand connected to <code>downPin<\/code>down to 0. When it’s all done, it waits for a second (1000 milliseconds) before repeating the process again.<\/p>\r\n<pre>\r\n<p><code>void loop() {<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>\/\/Variable to keep track of one of the pin assignments<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>\/\/as we swap them<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>int tmp;<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>\/\/Hold on to the current upPin value<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>tmp = upPin;<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>\/\/set upPin to the downPin value<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>upPin = downPin;<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>\/\/Then set downPin to what used to be in upPin<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>downPin = tmp;<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>\/\/Look through the voltage output values (from 0 to 255)<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>\/\/increment by 1<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt;= maxAnalog; i++) {<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp; \/\/Drive the upPin up to maxAnalog<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp; analogWrite(upPin, i);<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp; \/\/While simultaneously driving downPin down to 0<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp; analogWrite(downPin, maxAnalog - i);<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp; \/\/Pause for a little while<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp; delay(delayVal);<\/code>&gt;<\/p>\r\n<p><code>}<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>\/\/Wait a second before continuing<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>delay(1000);<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p><code>}<\/code><\/p>\r\n<\/pre>\r\n<h1>Variations<\/h1>\r\n<p>Make a version of this for different holidays. For example, Adafruit sells white and blue LED strands, so you can easily make a US 4<sup>th<\/sup> of July edition of the twinkle lights using the following parts:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Wire Light LED Strand - 12 Red LEDs + Coin Cell Holder (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/897\">https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/897<\/a>).<\/li>\r\n<li>Wire Light LED Strand - 12 Cool White LEDs + Coin Cell Holder (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/894\">https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/894<\/a>).<\/li>\r\n<li>Wire Light LED Strand - 12 Blue LEDs + Coin Cell Holder (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/895\">https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/products\/895<\/a>).<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>The code must be adjusted to sequentially fade the light strands – first red, then white, and finally blue, before repeating the series.

Having formerly lived near Cleveland, OH, I’m also a big concertgoer and see as many shows as I can. A while back, I signed up for Bandsintown (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bandsintown.com\">www.bandsintown.com<\/a>) as a way to know when the bands I’m interested in are going to be performing nearby. I don’t use the app much, but I have used it to highlight the bands I like. Recently, I’ve started getting emails like the following:<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/bandsintown-1.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1 – Useless Bandsintown Email<\/p>\r\n<p>When I saw this, I immediately said: “Oh, I wonder what Beth has to announce.” I’d be much happier if they’d just include the message content in the email to me – after all, why send me a message letting me know I have a message and NOT include the message in the message? That makes absolutely no sense and already Bandsintown is delivering a poor user experience UX.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, I clicked the link to see what Beth had to say and was presented with the following web page:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/bandsintown-2.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2 – Useless Bandsintown Web Page<\/p>\r\n<p>Apparently I don’t get to know what Beth has to say unless I fire up the app and see what her message is. I’m not going to do that. They’ve lost me as a user.<\/p>\r\n<p>What happened is they they’ve completely ignored the fact that I might check my email on my PC. In this case, I was. There’s no reason to send me to an app, when the medium they’re already using supports properly rendering the message. Even if they did want to send me to the app, which would have been an important piece of information to share with me in the original email message, they wait until I click the link and open a browser window before telling me that I can only read the message from the app.<\/p>\r\n<p>At this point, they lost me as a user since they clearly don’t care about me.<\/p>\r\n<p>Why do they feel the need to force me to use their app? By including Beth’s message in the email, they’re reinforcing their service in my mind, and increasing the chance that I’ll reopen their app. When I’m using my desktop PC to read my mail, there’s no way I’m switching to a smaller device with a smaller screen to read this message.<\/p>\r\n<p>My point here is that when you’re developing a marketing campaign or implementing features into your service, you have to pay attention to how people will use it as well as what they’ll be doing when they use it. In this case, they’ve made a faulty decision to assume everyone will be getting this email on their mobile device.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now, the last time I got one of these messages on my mobile device, I clicked on it, and the mobile app dutifully opened (as expected), but I wasn’t taken to the message. Instead the app opened and I found no way that I could actually read the message from the band. Sigh.

I want to be a bit more structured in how I secure microcontroller boards, so I&rsquo;ve been picking up different packs of spacers, standoffs, screws and so on. I was working on a project where I needed M2 standoffs, so I hopped on Amazon to see if they had something I could use. I found a promising collection of standoffs, screws and nuts in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B013ZWM1F6\">https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B013ZWM1F6<\/a>. I ordered it and it quickly arrived at my door (who doesn&rsquo;t love Amazon Prime?).<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/amazon-review-1.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, when I opened it, I found a product that was professionally and securely packaged. The contents therein were of reasonable quality, so I was pretty pleased with my purchase. As I started looking at it, I noticed that there was a disproportionate number of screws and nuts to posts and sockets. In other words, as you started to work through this kit, you&rsquo;d quickly run out of screws and nuts, leaving standoffs that you can&rsquo;t use for lack of connectors.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, I decided to write a review; first to let people know this appeared to be a quality product, and second to let them know it has a critical flaw. Being an experienced writer, I fired up Microsoft Word and got to work; my fingers quickly spat out the following<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">A great product and well packaged. The two containers came neatly packaged in a bag, each container has a solid clasp that should last the life of the product. The containers were taped shut, so there was little chance of everything falling out during shipment. Inside is a well-produced piece of paper listing the contents of each compartment. Well done.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">However, whoever created this kit didn&rsquo;t take into account how it would be used. The kit is woefully short on the number of screws and nuts you&rsquo;ll need to make full use of the product. No matter what happens, you&rsquo;re going to be heading out to buy more nuts and screws. Here&rsquo;s an example: the kit comes with 40 M2 male-female standoffs. To use these individually, as I plan to, you&rsquo;re going to need 40 screws and 40 nuts. The kit only ships with 20 of each. That doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me. There should be enough screws and nuts to accommodate all of the standoffs, not only half of them.<\/p>\r\n<p>I fired up my trusty browser and submitted this as a product review thinking it would be quickly published. Nope, not so much. A few minutes later, I received the following email:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/amazon-review-2.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2<\/p>\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the text so you&rsquo;ll be able to read it:<\/p>\r\n<p>Your review could not be posted.<\/p>\r\n<p>Thanks for submitting a customer review on Amazon.

I did not submit any obscene content, did not advertise anything or include any external links. I should be good, right?<\/p>\r\n<p>Thinking that they didn&rsquo;t like my comment about the person who created this kit. I thought perhaps that they didn&rsquo;t like me singling out the producer of this kit. I didn&rsquo;t mean the person who actually assembled the kit, but instead, the person who created it as a commercial product. So, using their submission guidelines as, well, a guide, I adjusted my content to remove the only content I considered to be even slightly offensive and resubmitted it:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">A great product and well packaged.

I thought the template I was using was mobile friendly. Nope, not so much.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, so I&rsquo;ve decided to update the template to something more&hellip;flexible. I&rsquo;ve picked one, and thrown it up here, but I may change it, and I definitely have some cleaning up to do to make it look better. So, in the meantime, you&rsquo;ll be able to view the content more easily on any device and over time you&rsquo;ll see it tightened up and well suited for any browser. Please be patient with me.<\/p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;d been having an issue with page navigation, but a template switch made that problem go away. Bonus.<\/p>\r\n<p>When I first started this site, I used an existing Joomla! plugin to manage formatting my code listings. That plugin wasn&rsquo;t updated over the years, and I&rsquo;ve not yet selected a replacement. One of the things I&rsquo;m going to be doing as I update this site is fixing that and pulling out all the old code formatting stuff. As I do this, code listings may be kinda ugly. I&rsquo;m sorry, but I&rsquo;ll fix this as soon as I can.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2017-01-29 19:38:22","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2017-01-29 19:38:22","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2017-01-29 19:38:22","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"1","ordering":"32","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"7229","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"483","asset_id":"629","title":"Using the Seeed Studio Raspberry Pi Relay Board","alias":"using-the-seeed-studio-raspberry-pi-relay-board","introtext":"<p>I had an idea for a project, a Raspberry Pi-based power controller for my media center. I searched around for relay boards, and discovered the Seeed Studio Raspberry Pi Relay Board v1.0 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.seeedstudio.com\/Raspberry-Pi-Relay-Board-v1.0-p-2409.html\">https:\/\/www.seeedstudio.com\/Raspberry-Pi-Relay-Board-v1.0-p-2409.html<\/a>, so I thought I'd give it a try.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Note<\/strong>: At the time, this was the only directly-mountable relay board I could find for the Raspberry Pi. Since then, I found another one in the ModMyPi PiOT Relay Board (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.modmypi.com\/raspberry-pi\/breakout-boards\/modmypi\/modmypi-piot-relay-board\">https:\/\/www.modmypi.com\/raspberry-pi\/breakout-boards\/modmypi\/modmypi-piot-relay-board<\/a>). I'll play with that one soon and publish my findings here; stay tuned.<\/p>\r\n<p>When I finally got around to playing with the hardware, I used (or should I say tried to use) Seeed Studio's Wiki Page for the board (<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.seeed.cc\/Raspberry_Pi_Relay_Board_v1.0\/\">http:\/\/wiki.seeed.cc\/Raspberry_Pi_Relay_Board_v1.0\/<\/a>) to guide my efforts. Unfortunately, I quickly learned that the article was incomplete and didn't have everything I needed to work with the board. I mounted the board on my Raspberry Pi, powered it up, ran their sample test application, and got nowhere. It simply didn't work.<\/p>\r\n<p>I sent Seeed Studios an email asking for help and posted a couple of questions on their community forums, but had to wait more than a month to get a response. When I finally did hear back, it was to let me know that they were on vacation and it would be an even longer wait for help. Sigh. Finally, they contacted me and offered to help.<\/p>\r\n<p>After another week of sending them screen shots, I finally got useful information and was able to get the board operational. The purpose of this article (and associated Github repository at <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/Seed-Studio-Relay-Board\">https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/Seed-Studio-Relay-Board<\/a>) is to show you how to use the board so you’ll avoid the issues I had.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Update<\/strong>: After publishing this article, I shared this information with the folks at Seeed Studio. They then updated their Wiki article with information directly copied from this article and the associated GitHub repository readme file. So, you'll finally find good, useful information on their product Wiki page - because I wrote it.<\/p>\r\n<p>In the Github repository, I shared the code Seeed provides to test the board (so that you can grab it using git rather than copying and pasting it from a Wiki page) plus a Python module (and associated test application) you can leverage to use the relay board in your own Raspberry Pi projects. I also created a complete Raspberry Pi relay controller application (using Python and Flask); I'll publish information about that soon.<\/p>\r\n<p>The steps for installing the board and verifying that it works includes the following steps:<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Mount the Relay board on the Raspberry Pi<\/li>\r\n<li>Enable the Raspbian I2C software interface<\/li>\r\n<li>Validate that the Raspberry Pi recognizes the board<\/li>\r\n<li>Run some Python code to exercise the board<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>In the rest of this article, I’ll show you how to do all of those things.<\/p>\r\n<h1>Mounting the Relay Board<\/h1>\r\n<p>Mounting the board is easy, it comes with the appropriate female headers you need to mount it on any Raspberry Pi board with male headers. Note: You’ll have to add male headers to the Raspberry Pi Zero to use the board.<\/p>\r\n<p>Seeed Studio recommends putting some electrical tape on top of the Raspberry Pi Ethernet port before mounting the board. If you mount the board without using standoffs (as I’ve done in the example figure below), there’s a chance the board will make contact with the Ethernet port housing and cause a problem.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/seed-figure-01.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>For a production project, I’d definitely recommend using standoffs to hold the two boards in place.<\/p>\r\n<p>The relay board is configured for an older Raspberry Pi with a 26 pin header, so when you connected it to a Raspberry Pi with 40 pin headers, you’ll need to shift it all the way to the side like I’ve shown in the figure. If you don’t align the pins correctly, you’ll have problems later as it simply won’t work.<\/p>\r\n<h1>Enabling I2C<\/h1>\r\n<p>The relay board communicates with the Raspberry Pi through an I2C interface (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/I%C2%B2C\">https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/I%C2%B2C<\/a>). This interface is disabled by default in the Pi’s Raspbian OS, so you’ll have to turn it on before you can use the board. Power up the Pi and let it boot to the graphical interface. When it’s up and running, open the <strong>Pi<\/strong> menu, select <strong>Preferences<\/strong>, then <strong>Raspberry Pi Configuration<\/strong> as shown in the following figure:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/seed-figure-02.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2<\/p>\r\n<p>In the window that opens, select the <strong>Interfaces<\/strong> tab as shown in the following figure. Enable the option next to I2C as shown in the figure and click the <strong>OK<\/strong> button to continue. When you reboot the PC, the Pi should see the relay board. In the next section, we’ll verify that the Pi sees the relay board.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/seed-figure-03.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 3<\/p>\r\n<h1>Validating the Raspberry Pi Sees the Relay Board<\/h1>\r\n<p>With the I2C interface enabled, it’s time to make sure the Raspberry Pi sees the relay board. Open a terminal window on the Pi and execute the following command:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>i2cdetect -y -r 1<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>The application will display a dump of the recognized I2C devices as shown in the following figure. In this example, there’s only one I2C board on the system, the relay board configured at an address of 20. You’ll see how this value is important later in this article.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/seed-figure-04.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 4<\/p>\r\n<p>You’re supposed to be able to use switches on the relay board to set the I2C address, but the Seeed Studio Wiki page contains no information on how that is accomplished. There are 4 DIP switches on the board, but your guess is as good as mine as to what they do. So, let’s see what happens when you change them.<\/p>\r\n<p>There are four switches, three labeled A0 through A2, and one labeled NC. I’m going to assume the NC means <strong>No Connection<\/strong> and leave that out of my analysis. Each switch has a high and a low setting, so the following table will lay out how to use them to set an I2C address for the board:<\/p>\r\n<table style=\"width: 681px; height: 150px;\"><caption>Table 1: Relay Board Switch Settings<\/caption>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\"><strong>A0<\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\"><strong>A1<\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\"><strong>A2<\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\"><strong>Address<\/strong><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>High<\/td>\r\n<td>High<\/td>\r\n<td>High<\/td>\r\n<td>20<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Low<\/td>\r\n<td>High<\/td>\r\n<td>High<\/td>\r\n<td>21<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>High<\/td>\r\n<td>Low<\/td>\r\n<td>High<\/td>\r\n<td>22<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>High<\/td>\r\n<td>High<\/td>\r\n<td>Low<\/td>\r\n<td>24<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>High<\/td>\r\n<td>Low<\/td>\r\n<td>Low<\/td>\r\n<td>26<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Low<\/td>\r\n<td>Low<\/td>\r\n<td>Low<\/td>\r\n<td>27<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n<h1>Running the Seeed Studio Test Application<\/h1>\r\n<p>The Seeed Studio Wiki includes the source code for a sample application you can run to test your application. The source code is listed on the Wiki, but when you copy it and paste it into your Python development environment, it won’t run correctly. Python uses indentation to indicate blocks of code, and when you copy the code from the Wiki, it’s not formatted properly for use. To make it easier for you, I formatted the code and included it in the Github repository listed earlier. Grab the code from there and you’ll be able to easily complete the following step.<\/p>\r\n<p>To run the test application, open a terminal window, navigate to where you’ve extracted the sample application and run the application using the following command:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>python .\/seeed_relay_test.py<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/seed-figure-05.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 5<\/p>\r\n<p>When prompted for input, you’ll type commands to turn the relays on and off:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Typing 1on, 2on, 3on, or 4on and pressing enter will cause the specified relay to turn on.<\/li>\r\n<li>Typing 1off, 2off, 3off, or 4off and pressing enter will cause the specified relay to turn off<\/li>\r\n<li>Typing allon or alloff will turn all relays on or off.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h1>Using The Python Module<\/h1>\r\n<p>To use the module in your own Python applications, copy the module (<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">relay_lib_seeed.py<\/span>) into your project folder, then import the module in your Python application by adding the following line to the beginning of your application:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>from relay_lib_seeed import *<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>This exposes a series of functions to your application:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>relay_on(int_value)<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>Turns a single relay on. Pass an integer value between 1 and 4 (inclusive) to the function to specify the relay you wish to turn on. For example: <code>relay_on(1)<\/code>will turn the first relay (which is actually relay 0 internally) on.<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>relay_off(int_value)<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>Turns a single relay on. Pass an integer value between 1 and 4 (inclusive) to the function to specify the relay you wish to turn on. For example: <code>relay_on(4)<\/code> will turn the first relay (which is actually relay 3 internally) off.<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>relay_all_on()<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>Turns all of the relays on simultaneously.<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>relay_all_off()<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>Turns all of the relays off simultaneously.<\/p>\r\n<p>The module exposes a configuration value you will want to keep in mind as you work with the board:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code># 7 bit address (will be left shifted to add the read write bit)<br \/>DEVICE_ADDRESS = 0x20<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>Remember that value? 20? The board defaults to this address. If you change the switches on the board, you will need to update this variable accordingly.<\/p>\r\n<p>To see the module in action, open a terminal window on the Raspberry Pi, navigate to the folder where you extracted this repository's files, and execute the following command:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>python .\/relay_lib_seeed_test.py<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>The application will:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Turn all of the relays on for a second<\/li>\r\n<li>Turn all of the relays off<\/li>\r\n<li>Cycle through each of the relays (1 through 4) turning each on for a second<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>The module will write indicators to the console as it performs each step as shown in the following figure:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/seed-figure-06.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 6<\/p>\r\n<p>LEDs on the relay board (one for each relay) will illuminate when the relays come one. On my board, they weren't in sequence, so don't expect them to light in order.<\/p>\r\n<p>The code that does all this looks like the following:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code># turn all of the relays on<br \/>relay_all_on()<br \/># wait a second<br \/>time.sleep(1)<br \/># turn all of the relays off<br \/>relay_all_off()<br \/># wait a second<br \/>time.sleep(1)<br \/># now cycle each relay every second in an infinite loop<br \/>while True:<br \/>   for i in range(1, 5):<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;relay_on(i)<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;time.sleep(1)<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;relay_off(i)<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>That’s it, that’s all there is to it.

{"id":"484","asset_id":"631","title":"Raspberry Pi Relay Controller","alias":"raspberry-pi-relay-controller","introtext":"<p>A while back, I built a Python library for the Seeed Studio Raspberry Pi Relay Controller board; I wrote about that project <a href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=483:using-the-seeed-studio-raspberry-pi-relay-board&amp;catid=41:microcontrollers-single-board-computers&amp;Itemid=458\">here<\/a>. As I worked to add some new features to the library, I realized that I needed an easy way to test the different components of the library. I decided to build a web application for the Raspberry Pi that provided an interface for each of the library’s functions. I built the application using Flask, an easy to use micro framework for Python; you can find the project’s complete source code at <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/Raspberry-Pi-Relay-Controller-Seeed\">https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/Raspberry-Pi-Relay-Controller-Seeed<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>When you install the application and configure the Pi to execute the project’s server task at startup, you can point your Pi browser to <code>http:\/\/127.0.0.1:5000<\/code> and you’ll see the following interface:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/pi-relay-controller-01.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>Here, you can turn each relay on or off, toggle the relay’s status and view the current status of the relay by clicking the buttons on the page. The All buttons (All On, All Off, and Toggle All) perform the specified operation on all of the relays simultaneously.<\/p>\r\n<p>For example, you can flip a set of relays easily using the Toggle All button. Turn two of the relays on (say, 1 and 3 for example), then click Toggle All to flip them all, turning 1 and 3 off while turning 2 and 4 on.<\/p>\r\n<p>To access the web application from outside of your Pi, you’ll have to first determine the Pi’s IP address. Open a terminal window and execute the following command:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>ifconfig<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>The Pi will display network configuration settings for each of the device’s network interfaces. If you’re running the Pi on a wired network connection, then you would use the inet addr highlighted in the following figure. If using a Wi-Fi network interface, then you’ll want the address for the wlan0 interface.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/pi-relay-controller-02.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2<\/p>\r\n<p>With that address in hand, simply use it to access the controller. Open the browser on any local network connected device and use the address, plus the port number as the page address. For example, for my configuration shown above, I would use the following:<\/p>\r\n<p><pre><code><a href=\"http:\/\/192.168.1.214:5000\">http:\/\/192.168.1.214:5000<\/a><\/code><\/pre><\/p>\r\n<p>The web application uses Bootstrap, so it will automatically render correctly on any size screen. For example, the following figure shows the same web application running on my Nexus 7 tablet.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/pi-relay-controller-03.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 3<\/p>\r\n<p>With this controller, you can connect different circuits to the relay board and flip them on and off as you validate your hardware. Then, when everything’s working as expected, you can code your own application logic for the Pi, replacing this generic controller for your actual application code.

The bromance started when I mentioned a quote out of Monty Python, and my new friend Tim, I call him Tim the Enchanter for obvious reasons, quickly responded with another quote. My wife quickly rolled her eyes, but I knew I had definitely had a new friend.<\/p>\r\n<p>Fast forward a few months and I was sitting in my bedroom reading a book when my wife grabbed me and dragged me to the front door. Apparently she &lsquo;saw some movement outside&rsquo; and I had to &lsquo;check it out&rsquo;. Anyway, I grab a firearm (just kidding) fling open the door, and what do I find? This, full of gifts:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/tim-the-enchanter-01.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Tim and his family reproduced the Trojan rabbit from Monty Python and the Holy Grail and left it on my front porch filled with presents.

{"id":"487","asset_id":"638","title":"Driving a Relay Board from Python Using GPIO Zero","alias":"driving-a-relay-board-from-python-using-gpio-zero","introtext":"<p>As you may have noticed, I’ve been working on a few projects lately that use relays. A while back, I bought some single, double and quad relay boards from yourduino.com (in China, I think). They were pretty inexpensive and I thought they’d work well for some of my projects. I never got around to using them – mostly because there were some jumpers on the board and no instructions and I really didn’t have the patience to figure out how they worked.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway I got this cool Paddle Breakout HAT from ModMyPi, so I had an easy way to wire up the Pi to the relay board. I connected the relay board to the Pi’s 5V output, Ground, and GPIO pin 18 then wrote a simple app to test it out. It worked! First try. Here’s a picture of the setup, the board on the left is the relay testing jig I wrote about here.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/pi-relay-board-setup.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>I created a GitHub Gist with the code, you can find that here in an easily digestible format: <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/johnwargo\/ea5edc8516b24e0658784ae116628277\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/gist.github.com\/johnwargo\/ea5edc8516b24e0658784ae116628277<\/a>.<br \/>The code uses the GPIO Zero library to interact with the relay board. You basically define an output device using the following code:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>relay = gpiozero.OutputDevice(18, active_high=False, initial_value=False)<\/code><code class=\"nohighlight\"><\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>Then, you turn the relay on by executing:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>relay.on()<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>And turn the relay off by executing:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>relay.off()<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>It couldn’t be simpler. Toggling the relay is easy too, just make a call to:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>relay.toggle()<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>The GPIO Zero library takes care of tracking relay status automatically.<\/p>\r\n<p>The relay board comes configured by default to trigger the relay when the input voltage goes low, so that’s why the output device initialization includes the <code>active_high=False<\/code> parameter. The <code>initial_value=False<\/code> simply makes sure the relay starts in an off status.<\/p>\r\n<p>Here’s the complete source code listing for the app:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>#!\/usr\/bin\/python<br \/># <a href=\"https:\/\/gpiozero.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/\">https:\/\/gpiozero.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/<\/a><br \/><\/code><code># <a href=\"https:\/\/gpiozero.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/api_output.html#outputdevice\">https:\/\/gpiozero.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/api_output.html#outputdevice<\/a><br \/><br \/>import sys<br \/><\/code><code>import time<br \/>import gpiozero<br \/><br \/>relay = gpiozero.OutputDevice(18, active_high=False, initial_value=False)<br \/><br \/>def set_relay(status):<br \/><\/code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if status:<br \/><\/code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print(\"Setting relay: ON\")<br \/><\/code><code>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; relay.on()<br \/><\/code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else:<br \/><\/code><code>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; print(\"Setting relay: OFF\")<br \/><\/code><code>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; relay.off()<br \/><br \/>def toggle_relay():<br \/><\/code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print(\"toggling relay\")<br \/><\/code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; relay.toggle()<br \/><br \/>def main_loop():<br \/><\/code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while 1:<br \/><\/code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # then toggle the relay every second until the app closes<br \/><\/code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; toggle_relay()<br \/><\/code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # wait a second<br \/><\/code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; time.sleep(1)<br \/><br \/>if __name__ == \"__main__\":<br \/><\/code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; try:<br \/><\/code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; main_loop()<br \/><\/code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; except KeyboardInterrupt:<br \/><\/code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # turn the relay off<br \/><\/code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; set_relay(False)<br \/>        <\/code><code>print(\"\\nExiting application\\n\")<br \/><\/code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # exit the application<br \/><\/code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sys.exit(0)<\/code><\/pre>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"41","created":"2017-03-25 15:06:40","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2017-11-07 02:49:51","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2017-03-25 15:06:40","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"12","ordering":"12","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"21461","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"488","asset_id":"639","title":"Ridiculous IBM Password Form","alias":"ridiculous-ibm-password-form","introtext":"<p><br \/>I needed to make some changes to my IBM newsletter subscription recently, so I clicked the ubiquitous Update Your Subscription link on the bottom of one of the newsletters. It had been a while since I logged in, so I had to go through the password reset process to get in. No worries, IBM had that covered, right? Yep, they sure did.<\/p>\r\n<p>When I clicked the &ldquo;Reset My Password&rdquo; link I received, I was presented with this form:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/ridiculous-ibm-password-form-01.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>Now I know IBM cares about password security, and they&rsquo;d force me to use some ridiculous, convoluted password character combination, but surprisingly the Create your new password form said ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about what those password requirements were.<\/p>\r\n<p>Sigh.<\/p>\r\n<p>OK, this makes absolutely no sense. This is IBM, I know they produce security products, and offer consulting services to help their customers with security. They absolutely have to have some sort of requirements for my password, there&rsquo;s no way they wouldn&rsquo;t. But, the form, produced by a professional software developer I imagine, makes absolutely no reference to any requirements.<\/p>\r\n<p>OK, so I thought for a while, and came up with the perfect password to use. As I started typing, the form changed to what you see below.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/ridiculous-ibm-password-form-02.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2<\/p>\r\n<p>Aaaah, so IBM does care about password security, but chose to wait until AFTER I&rsquo;d decided on a password to use before telling me what the password requirements are. This makes no sense &ndash; why wait until I&rsquo;ve started typing a password to tell me what I need to include in my password? That is never a good idea. Statistically, there&rsquo;s limited chance I&rsquo;m going to get this right without knowing what the password requirements are, so what this means is that EVERY SINGLE USER who uses this form will have to correct their chosen password upon receiving this previously hidden information. Ugh!<\/p>\r\n<p>Instead of letting users know in advance what the password requirements are, and allowing the user to pick their password with all the information they need at hand, IBM choses to let the majority of their visitors (a small percentage, a very small percentage, will get it right anyway) select a password that won&rsquo;t comply with the requirements before even telling them what the requirements are.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now do you see why this is a Stupid Developer Trick (SDT)?<\/p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve said this before, and apparently will continue to need to do so, respect your users and give them ALL OF THE INFORMATION THEY NEED before they need it, not after they need it. That&rsquo;s the minimum any of us should expect from any input form.<\/p>\r\n<p>OK, so now I know I need an 8 character password, so I&rsquo;m good, right?<\/p>\r\n<p>Nope, there&rsquo;s another warning as well that I can&rsquo;t figure out. It&rsquo;s possible the form is telling me that I can&rsquo;t use a previous password, but that&rsquo;s not guaranteed since the message is vague. Is it warning me that I shouldn&rsquo;t use a previous password or telling me that I can&rsquo;t use a previous password? Also, when it tells me not to use another password, is that another password I used previously on this site? Or another password I&rsquo;ve used anywhere else at any time? I can&rsquo;t tell, can you?<br \/>Well, at this point, I&rsquo;m going to wing it and start to enter the password I&rsquo;ve picked for myself. As I type this password, the form changes yet again. Only now does it have more password requirement information for me.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/ridiculous-ibm-password-form-03.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 3<\/p>\r\n<p>So, apparently you have to keep adjusting the password you want to use as the password continues to provide pertinent information as you type. You&rsquo;ve got to kidding me &ndash; does IBM hate its customers?<\/p>\r\n<p>Finally, after poking and prodding at the password, changing what I&rsquo;m planning to use every time the password form gave me additional information about the password requirements, I was eventually able to enter an acceptable password.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/ridiculous-ibm-password-form-04.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 4<\/p>\r\n<p>What an absolutely horrible experience. Now, it could have been worse, but as password forms go, this is pretty horrible. You know what&rsquo;s the funniest part of this? Developers, as you work on implementing password forms, or any other type of form, be sure to give the user all of the information they need to accurately populate the form. Don&rsquo;t wait for them to make an error to tell them what they need to fill out your form. Tell them right up front. Identify all required fields, show input field patterns when they exist (like phone number, date or credit card) and treat them like you like them, not like you consider how to fill out the form to be a mystery.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"40","created":"2017-03-25 15:33:31","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2017-03-25 15:33:31","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2017-03-25 15:33:31","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"1","ordering":"3","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"7282","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

(I run sites using both Joomla, WordPress and even a Concrete5 site). I&rsquo;m not quite sure how they&rsquo;re doing it; I&rsquo;ve looked online for others having this problem, but really never found anything. I posted questions on the Joomla forums, but couldn&rsquo;t get an answer.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The files show up in the site&rsquo;s images folder, usually just in that folder, but sometimes subfolders as well. The files are usually .jpg files, showing some sort of hacker badge or message; occasionally they&rsquo;re just random images. Sometimes I&rsquo;ll get .txt files, and a few weeks ago, for a couple of days I got .pdf files that, for some bizarre reason, Google quickly picked up in their search results.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Needless to say, this was pretty annoying. I don&rsquo;t think anything else on my site was compromised (I checked) and both my ISP&rsquo;s malware detection and SiteGuard didn&rsquo;t find anything at risk on my site. The admin tool I use didn&rsquo;t block the attacks though, so every day, more and more files popped-up in that folder or subfolders, sometimes 30 per day. Sigh.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I thought perhaps there was something wrong with my hosting account. I ran multiple sites from the same account, so I decided to create a new, separate hosting account for just this one site. At the time, I wasn&rsquo;t using SiteLock, so I added that to this new account thinking that if hackers were doing something weird, SiteLock would catch it. No such luck, no change.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I attended <a href=\"https:\/\/conferences.oreilly.com\/oscon\/oscon-tx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OSCON<\/a> a couple of years back (I wish I could attend this year, I really loved that conference) and attended a session about protecting your site from hackers. The presenter (I won&rsquo;t name names right now; you&rsquo;ll understand why in a little bit) did a really good job highlighting different ways hackers got into your site (although mostly targeting WordPress sites) and showed some tools you could use to identify and fix hacks. Cool stuff. I applied some of the strategies and tools to my site to no avail &ndash; the hackers kept hacking away.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I reached out to the presenter to that session and asked for help. She gave me some suggestions to try and I eventually hired her company to completely rebuild my site from scratch. Her team backed up the site, restored it to a new folder and checked everything for malware, cleaned it up and switched my URL to the new instance. No change, anywhere from 5 to 30 images hacked into my site&rsquo;s images folder almost every day.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I spoke with several technical people at my ISP and got no help. One guy suggested that I that I disable file upload for the site. I&rsquo;m sure that would have helped, but that would have made it hard for me to add images to my articles, so I put that one aside until I became completely desperate.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The kind and helpful people at SiteLock assessed the situation and suggested that I could fix my problem by buying a higher level of protection. Yeah, that would have been useful, but, I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m not going to plunk down $600 per year to protect my personal blog. That&rsquo;s simply too much.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I&rsquo;d been using an old JoomlaShack template for my site for many years. When Google announced that they would be giving mobile-friendly sites preference in search results, I started assessing my existing site&rsquo;s mobile-friendliness and found it lacking. So, I decided to switch templates and make this site mobile-friendly. This was a fun and exciting project. Once I got started, it didn&rsquo;t take me very long to complete the project.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As I tested the different parts of my now mobile-friendly site, I was surprised to see that at the bottom of every article list, the site displayed a button labeled &ldquo;New&rdquo;. I quickly tested the button and found that I could add new articles to the site &ndash; even when not logged into the site! Holy crikey, I think I found the source of my problem!<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I tested a few things, and eventually reset my site&rsquo;s permissions in order to block that particular button. Of course, I broke the site doing this, but at least I killed that button. As I sorted out trying to fix the broken site, I noticed that I was no longer getting image files uploaded to my site by hackers. Woohoo! That particular problem was fixed. I watched the site for a few weeks, no extraneous images. Hackers are finally blocked.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I think what happened is that this particular site started as a Joomla 1.5 site many years ago. Over the years, I upgraded it all the way up to Joomla 3.6 and I think that during the many upgrade processes, the site&rsquo;s permissions somehow got corrupted. I&rsquo;m sure there was a major ACL overhaul during that period and I imagine that was the source of my issue.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">OK, so the hackers are blocked, but only because I&rsquo;ve hosed up the site&rsquo;s permission settings and even I can&rsquo;t get in. The Joomla.org forums were useless, I got ridiculous responses like &ldquo;don&rsquo;t mess with permissions when you don&rsquo;t understand them&rdquo; and &ldquo;that New button was there because you probably forgot you were logged in&rdquo; so I had to fix this myself. I quickly determined that the site&rsquo;s assets table held the permission settings, so I copied records from a working instance to this broken one and I was able to get back in.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I knew my Joomla permissions were &lsquo;broken&rsquo; so I purchased a license to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aclmanager.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ACL Manager for Joomla!<\/a>, installed the plugin and let it clean up my permissions and assets table. That was it, everything fixed. It&rsquo;s been several weeks now and I haven&rsquo;t been hacked once.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; <\/span>I can&rsquo;t tell you how many months (or perhaps is it years, who knows?) that I dealt with this issue (it&rsquo;s embarrassing). I&rsquo;m just excited to have it fixed.

{"id":"492","asset_id":"643","title":"Android Spam Phone Call Detection","alias":"android-spam-phone-call-detection","introtext":"<p>A recent update to the Android OS on my smartphone triggered a new feature I really like a lot. I&rsquo;ve started getting more and more spam phone calls on my phone, and Google is now building a list of spam numbers and letting me block them when the calls come in.<\/p>\r\n<p>When a call comes in from a suspicious caller, after you hang up, Android asks me if this was a spam message. If I want, I can block the number right here as shown in the figure.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/android-spam-call-detection-01.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>If I skip this for whatever reason, I can still pull down the alerts list and activate blocking as shown in the following figure.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/android-spam-call-detection-02.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #000000;\" height=\"365\" width=\"480\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2<\/p>\r\n<p>This is a really cool feature, something I&rsquo;m sure a lot of companies would try to charge you for, but in Google&rsquo;s case, it&rsquo;s just another feature of the OS.<\/p>\r\n<p>This feature blends well into what I&rsquo;m calling the World Without Apps (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.aworldwithoutapps.com\">www.aworldwithoutapps.com<\/a>) where more of your day to day activities will be controlled by agents on your smartphone, your home, your car, whatever. In this particular case, I believe this functionality is provided by the device&rsquo;s Phone application, but I&rsquo;m not sure. Regardless, the UX\/UI of this particular feature appears at the system level &ndash; the alert pops up as you&rsquo;re answering the phone (through an overlay over what you&rsquo;re currently doing when the call comes in) or through the alerts area of the OS, NOT directly in the Phone application. See?<\/p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m curious how long it will be before the OS simply listens to the beginning of the call. If there&rsquo;s a long delay on the other end, before an agent eventually clicks in to begin selling me something, my phone agent can quickly tell its spam, especially when I loudly curse and hang up, and block the phone number automatically if they ever call again.<\/p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, blocking the number directly really doesn&rsquo;t help me. The chance I&rsquo;ll get another call from this same number is slim. It does, however, help other people who get calls from this number, letting them know other people like me think this is spam and offering them a chance to not take the call. That&rsquo;s valuable.<\/p>\r\n<p>Eventually the technology will get good enough that the calls from these numbers won&rsquo;t even disrupt me, they&rsquo;ll be blocked by the OS and I&rsquo;ll never even know.<\/p>\r\n<p>A recent trend in spam calling is to make it look like the call is coming from your own number &ndash; the thinking apparently that any blocking software you use won&rsquo;t be configured to block calls from this number. It wouldn&rsquo;t be a hard update to the OS to simply add logic that if the phone gets a call from itself, immediately block it.

{"id":"493","asset_id":"644","title":"WebWatcher - When Software Companies Get Greedy","alias":"webwatcher-when-software-companies-get-greedy","introtext":"<p>I have teenage twins in the house. When I first got them smartphones, my wife and I wanted to be able to see everything they did on their phones to protect them and, well, to keep an eye on them. I looked around and WebWatcher was a highly rated solution. My sister had a coupon, so I purchased a license, installed it, and started monitoring my kids’ smartphone activities. My wife and I also told the kids that we’d be watching everything they do on their phones, so there’d be no surprises when I started asking them about their online activities.<\/p>\r\n<p>I pretty quickly learned that I’d made a mistake with my purchase.<\/p>\r\n<p>The capabilities WebWatcher provides are useful and work fairly well, but the parent portal is very cumbersome to use and looks like it was created with really, really outdated tools. It has a dated look that seems out of place with all of the beautiful web interfaces available today. Apparently WebWatcher isn’t using its income to improve the UX or UI of its tools. As you can see in the figure below, the admin UI looks very…web 1.0 app circa 2001.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/webwatcher-01.png\" alt=\"WebWatcher Admin Console\" width=\"641\" height=\"417\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1 – WebWatcher Admin Console<\/p>\r\n<p>With all of the amazing, data-aware HTML and JavaScript frameworks available today, you’d think they’d be able to deliver a better UI.<\/p>\r\n<p>Next, I realized that WebWatcher only holds collected data for a short period of time. In order to be able to view the history of your child’s activities, you have to pay for additional storage to store your data. They don’t mention that when you’re buying the license, but begin pestering you immediately after your purchase with emails offering to increase your storage for a fee. I finally had to turn off most email alerts just to get them to stop begging me for additional money.<\/p>\r\n<p>This was the first indication of WebWatcher’s greedy nature. As you can see from Figure 2, it will cost you another $10 per month ($120US per year) for 100 MB of storage. If your kids take a lot of photos, that storage will disappear pretty quickly.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/webwatcher-02.png\" alt=\"WebWatcher Storage Pricing\" width=\"640\" height=\"433\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2 – WebWatcher Storage Pricing<\/p>\r\n<p>In comparison, Google Drive offers 15 GB of storage for free (15 times more storage than WebWatcher’s $10\/month offering); yes, free! Amazon Drive offers unlimited storage for $60US (infinitely, literally infinitely, more than what you get for WebWatcher’s $120US per year at half the price). Those are big companies, right? These cloud companies have a lot of resources, so they can offer a greater discount on storage right? So let’s consider Acronis, a small PC backup company, their $39.99US software product offering includes 1 TB of storage for one year. There’s a whole bunch of other companies that offer an amazing amount of storage for much less than WebWatcher offers its customers. iDrive backup solution? 5 GB for free, 1 TB for $70 per year. DropBox offers 25 GB of free storage for anyone.<\/p>\r\n<p>As you can see, WebWatcher’s prices are ridiculous when you consider other data storage options.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now, their pricing might be high because they’re running their own data centers, and can’t offer the prices that these other guys do. I get that. What I object to is that WebWatcher didn’t mention anywhere in the product information pages that you get limited storage for your account. No mention at all of storage limits and the pricing for additional storage. You can only see these options after you’ve purchased licenses and have logged into the admin console. That’s deceitful.<\/p>\r\n<p>The only reference to storage appears when you add a license to the shopping cart as shown in the following figure. Here, they tell you that you get unlimited data storage for your viewing period. There’s no mention anywhere of what your viewing period is. Right now it’s 7 days, to view any of your data after that, you have to buy storage.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/webwatcher-03.png\" alt=\"WebWatcher Add-on Products\" width=\"640\" height=\"295\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 3 – WebWatcher Add-on Products<\/p>\r\n<p>Of course, my son quickly broke his phone and I had to buy a replacement for it. After poking around on the WebWatcher UI, I was unable to figure out how to revoke the license for my son’s current phone and move it to his new on. I had to submit a support ticket in order to be able to figure out how to do it as there’s no documentation for this. Apparently, to revoke a license from a device, you have to ‘Reset’ it. That makes no sense, but apparently that’s how the WebWatcher folks view revoking a license from a device. This makes no sense, but it is what it is.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now, if you think about it, this is a product for watching kid’s activities on their smartphones, so there’s a reasonable expectation that you’re going to be periodically switching phones. My son broke a few before he got comfortable with it (he’s apparently clumsy) and, of course, he has phone envy and always wants a better phone. So, over the last few years, I’ve had to go in and revoke (oh, I’m sorry, reset) the license.<\/p>\r\n<p>With his latest phone upgrade, I went into the WebWatcher portal interface and tried to revoke (I refuse to say reset) his license. The process failed, and I received the following error:<\/p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>One or more licenses are not reset due to the absence of backup protection product, or not enough available resets from backup protection product(s).<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<p>Backup protection? I don’t need backup protection, there’s nothing about this that requires backup.<\/p>\r\n<p>I sent off a request to support and quickly learned:<\/p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Note: if you can’t do the reset due to the absence of ‘backup insurance’ ($19.95) then you need to purchase it as a ‘returning customer’ it will ask you to login your account.<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<p>Remember Figure 3? It describes this backup service:<\/p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Backup Insurance Program<br \/>Keep a backup digital copy of WebWatcher in case you need to re-install for any reason (i.e., the monitored device is lost, stolen, crashes, or is replaced). 2 re-installs permitted per year.<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<p>So I have to buy ‘backup insurance’ in order to reinstall the license when I replace devices. That’s ridiculous. Recognizing that kids will break, lose or upgrade phones, WebWatcher wants to charge you an additional $10 merely for the privilege of reinstalling the license.<\/p>\r\n<p>That’s ridiculous. Notice it’s $9.95, but that’s for one license. In my case, it’s $19.90.<\/p>\r\n<p>I’m not paying it – just on principle. With all of the deceptive marketing and costly add-ons, this solution is not cost effective for me. The yearly license renewal (yep, it’s a yearly license) is already $200 per year for me. As I add ‘backup’ and additional storage, the solution will cost me more than $300 per year and that’s way, way too much. Especially now that Google offers Google Family for Android.<\/p>\r\n<p>I’m canceling my WebWatcher renewal and implementing another monitoring solution for my kids’ smartphones.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2017-04-12 12:02:30","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2022-12-04 00:56:11","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2017-04-12 12:02:30","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"4","ordering":"30","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"7894","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"494","asset_id":"645","title":"Implemented Google Wi-Fi","alias":"implemented-google-wi-fi","introtext":"<p>I had an interesting SMS conversation with my son the other day. The conversation went like this:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/google-wi-fi-01.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1<\/p>\r\n<p>I was at a concert with my wife (we saw Jonny Lang) and we noticed that the kids were watching a show on the Apple TV (I&rsquo;ll explain how later) when they were supposed to be in going to bed, so I turned off Wi-Fi to the Apple TV. Here&rsquo;s the story...<\/p>\r\n<p>My brother in law recommended I get the Linksys WRT 1900 Apache Cordova Router. My brother in law liked how it allowed you to configure a separate guest network and some other features, so I got it and put it to work.<\/p>\r\n<p>Ultimately, though, I didn&rsquo;t like the results I got with this router. True, it allowed me to implement a guest network, but bizarrely the guest network had different passphrase requirements than the primary network. The primary network allowed me to set a passphrase containing spaces, but for some ridiculous reason, the guest network password couldn&rsquo;t handle passphrases, it had to be a password instead (with no spaces). It had other interesting features, like the ability to set priority devices and some other stuff, so I used a guest password I wasn&rsquo;t happy with and left it in place.<\/p>\r\n<p>Fast forward a couple of years later and al of a sudden, I can&rsquo;t connect to the Wi-Fi network in my office with any of my mobile devices. I&rsquo;d reboot the Wi-Fi hotspot or reboot the devices and get on the network, but ultimately it wasn&rsquo;t working. Gone are the days where I can troubleshoot a network, I just don&rsquo;t have the bandwidth for it anymore, so I decided to swap out the hardware for a better solution.<\/p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;d been looking at the Google Router for a while now; a friend uses one and configured it to use the OpenDNS service for name resolution (and site blocking). I thought that might be a good solution, but then I started reading about Google Wi-Fi and its ability to implement a mesh network. I decided to give this solution a try and purchased and setup a three pack of the devices in the house.<\/p>\r\n<p>My office is in an outbuilding, and I thought I&rsquo;d leave my hotspot in my office, but when I setup the new network, I disconnected the hotspot in my office and noticed that I had good coverage from the house. So, three devices, distributed through the house was enough to cover my office and workshop as well. Nice!<\/p>\r\n<p>The setup process is really simple, you install the first device and connect it to your cable\/DSL modem using a standard Ethernet cable. When you fire up the app, it walks you through setting up the network, creating a primary and guest networks &ndash; both allowing passphrases (woohoo!), of course. Next, you add each additional unit, and let the app configure its Wi-Fi mesh.<\/p>\r\n<p>It only took a few minutes and I was all setup. A quick test with my mobile devices and they all connected just fine to the new network. Even my desktop PC, a couple of Raspberry Pi devices and my smart devices all connected to the new network automatically. I didn&rsquo;t have to restart or muck with it in any way. Nice!<\/p>\r\n<p>I started poking around in the Google Wi-Fi mobile app (Google insists in calling it WiFi, but since that&rsquo;s not how you spell Wi-Fi, I&rsquo;m not going to use their spelling); the app opens to a view of your network:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/google-wi-fi-02.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2<\/p>\r\n<p>Here, I can quickly tell whether my Internet connection is up. I can view the status of my Wi-Fi units, and I can view all of the devices on the network (wired or Wi-Fi).<\/p>\r\n<p>When you tap on the Wi-Fi points, you&rsquo;ll see each of the units and the current device&rsquo;s connectivity to each. In the following image, you can see that I have a good connection to the Family Room and a poor connection to the &lsquo;Hallway&rsquo; device. This is good as the Family Room device is closest to me, but even if that one goes down, I can still see signal from the device that&rsquo;s furthest away.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/google-wi-fi-03.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 3<\/p>\r\n<p>You can also test the network, notice the &lsquo;Test Mesh&rsquo; button in the bottom-right corner of the figure. When you tap on the button, the app begins a network check:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/google-wi-fi-04.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 4<\/p>\r\n<p>Followed by a Mesh check:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/google-wi-fi-05.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 5<\/p>\r\n<p>And finally the Wi-Fi network (which I&rsquo;m not showing). Anyway, there&rsquo;s lots of information about the network which is really useful and very easy to use (especially compared to the Linksys solution I used previously).<\/p>\r\n<p>When you access the Devices section of the app, you&rsquo;re presented with a list of all of the devices currently using the network. When you open a device, you can view the device&rsquo;s usage of the network (which is useful) but you can also edit it&rsquo;s display name, enabling you to name devices based on how you view the device, not the way the network sees the device. So, I&rsquo;ve named my Amazon Echo devices based on where they&rsquo;re located (kitchen, office, etc), my computers based on my name for them and so on. At the end of this process, I had a complete list of devices I could view, all named the way I wanted them named. Cool stuff.<\/p>\r\n<p>On to the SMS conversation I showed you at the top of the article. One of the things the app allows you to do is setup Family Wi-Fi settings. Here you can define groups of devices (my kid&rsquo;s devices for example) and control when they can access the network.<\/p>\r\n<p>I quickly setup a family group for my twins and added their smartphones, tablets and Chromebooks to the list. With that in place, I configured the group so it shut off network access to those devices on school nights between 9:30 PM and 6 AM as shown in the following figure.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2017\/google-wi-fi-10.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 6<\/p>\r\n<p>With this in place, Sundays through Thursday nights, the twins&rsquo; access shuts down when it&rsquo;s time for them to be in bed. Nice stuff.<\/p>\r\n<p>The app also allows you to pause individual devices. So, as I explained at the beginning of the article, I was able to see through the app that the Apple TV was consuming bandwidth, indicating that my kids were watching something, and I quickly paused access to shut them down. What fun!<\/p>\r\n<p>I paused it permanently, but it seems like I could have only paused it for a limited time (which I&rsquo;ll do the next time). My son called me today, three days later, asking me to turn the Apple TV back on &ndash; apparently it was off all this time.<\/p>\r\n<p>Other features that are interesting:<\/p>\r\n<p>Allows for reserving IP addresses &ndash; I really want my printers and Raspberry Pi devices to have dedicated IP addresses, so I was able to use the app to reserve addresses for them. The Pi&rsquo;s took the change without pause, my printers have yet to recognize the IP address assigned to them. I assume that will happen when their current IP address lease expires.<\/p>\r\n<p>The app also allows you to set additional admins for the network, so I quickly added my wife and showed here how to turn things on\/off. Only the owner of the network, me, can do that, so there&rsquo;s no chance my kids will be able to install the app and manipulate the network. My smartphone and tablet are all locked to my fingerprint, so they can&rsquo;t access anything without cutting off my finger.<\/p>\r\n<p>Some drawbacks, there&rsquo;s no way to print a device list. I want to print the network information so I can file it away, but that&rsquo;s not possible. The Google devices sport an API that may expose this information, I&rsquo;m not sure. The API&rsquo;s not public. There&rsquo;s also an associated cloud service, but no published API there either. Hopefully (although Hope is NOT a Strategy) Google will expose some additional capabilities through the desktop browser someday.<\/p>\r\n<p>Another drawback is that when you open a device, then return to the device list, the list refreshes every time. When I was going through each device, setting its name, it was quite annoying that I had to scroll back to my place every time. I wish Google would expose a setting that would let me disable list refreshes while I&rsquo;m working with the list.<\/p>\r\n<p>In all, an incredible experience and the system exposes most everything I need to manage my network (and annoy my kids). I did implement OpenDNS as well, to give me more control over what the kids can see and some additional reporting on the sites they access. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll write about that someday soon.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2017-04-22 18:49:33","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2017-04-22 18:52:27","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2017-04-22 18:49:33","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"2","ordering":"29","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"6996","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"495","asset_id":"648","title":"Give Me a Library, Please?","alias":"give-me-a-library-please","introtext":"<p>I’ve been doing a lot of work lately on several IoT projects. For a while last year, I worked on some documentation for an IoT platform, but for the most part, I’ve been working on some personal projects. Recently, I’ve been trying to build a better power timer – using relays and a microcontroller to turn a light on and off on a schedule, even using sunrise and sunset as triggers (you can see some of my work <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/raspberry-pi-relay-timer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/Aduino-RTC-Relay-Static\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>). I recently discovered some relay boards for the Raspberry Pi platform, and started working with them. My experiences with these boards, and the sample code provided for each, incented me to write this post today.<\/p>\r\n<p>When you’re working with someone else’s hardware, chances are that you don’t know how to ‘use’ the hardware in your project. That’s why vendors typically include some sample programs to show you how to work with their board, right? The problem is, these sample programs are typically written by a hardware guy trying to show that the board works instead of being written by someone trying to show you how to use the hardware in your project.<\/p>\r\n<p>What these vendors must do is make a list of the core things a developer will want to do with the hardware, then build code that quickly and easily enables developers to do those things. Once all that code is written and tested, vendors should publish the code as stand-alone libraries that developers can easily plunk into their apps and use.<\/p>\r\n<p>Instead of the huge Kitchen Sink app, with UI and functional code intermixed, pull out the functional code into stand-alone libraries for easy consumption. Then, build a separate UI or interaction app that uses the library to interact with the hardware. That way, developers have an easy way to determine how to interact with the board from their applications (by looking at the library code) and an easy way to interact with the hardware (the UI app) to make sure it works or to see how it works. This simple separation of concerns dramatically increases a developer’s (experienced or inexperienced) ability to come up to speed with your hardware.<\/p>\r\n<p>As an example of what not to do (and what prompted me to write this post), take a look at the code for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.modmypi.com\/raspberry-pi\/breakout-boards\/modmypi\/modmypi-piot-relay-board\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ModMyPi PiOT Relay board<\/a> at <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/modmypi\/PiOT-Relay-Board\/blob\/master\/piot5.py\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/github.com\/modmypi\/PiOT-Relay-Board\/blob\/master\/piot5.py<\/a>. In this example, you’ll see 424 lines of code for this relay board; I’m guessing here, but you’ll see, I’ll bet, more than 300 lines of UI code and only about 30 lines of code that actually show you how to work with the relay board. It took me a while looking through the code to find those 30 lines that I needed to learn how to use the board in my projects. Its those 30 lines or so that I want the developer to pull out into a library for me – to make it easy for me to see how to use the board.<\/p>\r\n<p>In this example, it gets even worse. This relay board has 4 relays, and the only code the developer provides is code to toggle all or individual relays. Thinking through the use cases, developers may want to turn a relay off or on as well. What good is the ability to toggle a relay when I’m not certain of the relay’s status?<\/p>\r\n<p>What I did was think through how an app will want to interact with the board and came up with the following:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Turn a relay on<\/li>\r\n<li>Turn a relay off<\/li>\r\n<li>Toggle a relay (on to off or off to on)<\/li>\r\n<li>Turn all relays on<\/li>\r\n<li>Turn all relays off<\/li>\r\n<li>Toggle all relays<\/li>\r\n<li>Get Relay status (is the specified port on or off?)<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>This list is what any project may need to do with this board, so that’s what must be coded in the example application to help developers, especially inexperienced developers, can get up and running quickly.

My manager had a speaking slot, but due to a promotion to a different team, he was no longer able to fulfil his commitment to the conference. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>ReactiveConf is held in Bratislava, Slovakia; it is a dual stage conference focusing on development topics; mostly web, but some mobile. Presenters came from all over the world (most from the US), so there was a good variety of topics on the agenda. Apparently the conference grew to more than 1,000 attendees this year.<\/p>\r\n<p>I brainstormed a topic with a colleague, and quickly submitted my session title and abstract along with my bio and photograph. For my session, I wanted to do something with React Native and Visual Studio App Center (the Microsoft product I work on), so I decided to show how to use Visual Studio App Center’s CodePush and Push services to implement A\/B testing in a React Native application.<\/p>\r\n<p>To make this work, you publish multiple versions of your React Native application into different App Center CodePush deployments. With those in place, you use the App Center Push service to send a push notification to multiple devices, inside the notification, you include a custom object containing the Deployment ID for the version of the application you want the device to use. On receipt of the notification, code in the application uses CodePush to pull down the specified version of the app content. At the conclusion of the A\/B test, you simply send another push notification to the devices, resetting the Deployment ID to the app’s original version.<\/p>\r\n<p>I’ve attached my presentation at the bottom of this article, for more details on my session, check out my blog post on the Visual Studio App Center blog (coming soon).<\/p>\r\n<p>{youtube}X9iqnovPGyY?t=21280{\/youtube}<\/p>\r\n<p>Even though I only planned on delivering one session at the conference, I found ways to deliver some additional sessions:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The conference scheduled several quick, 10-minute lightning talks on a variety of topics, so I volunteered to deliver one. They had an online vote to see if anyone wanted to see my presentation, and I got voted in. In my session (they only allocated me 4 minutes, but that was enough) I demonstrated how to use a new feature of Visual Studio Code to enhance developer productivity. You basically add <a href=\"mailto:\/\/ts-check to\">\/\/@ts-check to<\/a> the top of any JavaScript file, and Visual Studio Code applies the TypeScript compiler to the file and highlights JavaScript errors you wouldn’t know about otherwise.<\/li>\r\n<li>The third day of the conference was Festival Day, and was held at a local university. The conference asked me (and some other presenters) to participate in an inspirational talk, to describe to University students how I got started in this field and what inspires me. There was no preparation for this session, I merely talked about myself and answered some questions.

This particular PC is three years old, so I expected to see some failures. It wasn’t too bad as my system has a 512 GB SSD as its boot drive, but an 8 TB RAID array for all my apps, data, games, etc. I ordered a replacement drive and was quickly back in business.<\/p>\r\n<p>Weirdness ensued when I tested the ‘bad’ drive using the manufacturer's diagnostics and it passed with flying colors. I assumed that the original failure was just a fluke, so I ran the tests a few more times and set the drive aside to use when another drive failed.<\/p>\r\n<p>A week or so later, another drive in the RAID array failed. Knowing I had a ‘good’ spare lying around, I swapped the drives and got to work. Unfortunately, the array came back up, but then quickly failed again. Since I knew the drive tested good, I started looking for other sources for my problem.<\/p>\r\n<p>I swapped all my drive cables, split the array across two power supply rails, but the problem persisted. At this point, I ordered a new motherboard and installed it only to find that the problem persisted. Thinking through this, I started swapping the drives around and noticed that the problem moved with the drive. I then swapped the old, bad drive back in and the problem persisted. Crikey, two bad drives.<\/p>\r\n<p>I should have swapped the drives around before I ordered the motherboard; if I’d done that, I would have noticed that the failure followed the drive, eliminating the possibility that it was a motherboard problem. My second failure was assuming that the original failed drive was still good It turns out that the drive works when first connected, but then fails a while later. &nbsp;The evidence showed that, but I ignored it when the drive passed diagnostics.<\/p>\r\n<p>I finally ordered another replacement drive, plugged it in, and I’m all set; everything is working as planned.<\/p>\r\n<p>I also used this as an opportunity to format my system and do a clean installation of Windows. This is the only system I’ve EVER upgraded (from Windows 8 to Windows 10, what happened to Windows 9, I can’t tell you), and I was having some problems. The biggest of which was that my Windows Store instance was corrupt, and I couldn’t install or upgrade any Windows Store apps on the system. &nbsp;I encountered some problems with the re-install, I’ll share those experiences in my next post.<\/p>\r\n<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2017-12-04 16:57:32","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2017-12-04 16:57:32","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2017-12-04 16:57:32","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"1","ordering":"25","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"4913","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

{"id":"505","asset_id":"658","title":"My First Digital Hotel Key","alias":"my-first-digital-hotel-key","introtext":"<p>I’m staying in San Francisco this week and when I checked into my hotel, they offered me an opportunity to use a digital key to get into my room. That seemed like a fun and interesting thing to do, so I said yes and began the process.<\/p>\r\n<p>For some bizarre reason, Hilton requires some legal process to get my key; I had to agree to some terms in order to use this option (I don’t understand why, and I didn’t read them before I accepted them). I eventually got an email letting me know that my digital key was being generated and would be delivered to my phone (actually the hotel app on the phone) once my room was ready. When I got to my hotel and opened the app, I saw what you see in the following figure; a button in the lower-left corner with an option to open my room using the app. Nice!<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<figure><img src=\"images\/stories\/2018\/digital-hotel-key-01.png\" alt=\"Digital Room Key 1\" title=\"Digital Room Key 1\" \/><figcaption>Digital Room Key 1<\/figcaption><\/figure>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>When I tapped on the key, I was instructed to get close to the door I wanted to open as shown in the following figure. I’m assuming it’s using Bluetooth Low Energy to detect if I’m close to the door, and hopefully it knows which door I’m close to.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<figure><img src=\"images\/stories\/2018\/digital-hotel-key-02.png\" alt=\"Digital Room Key 2\" title=\"Digital Room Key 2\" \/><figcaption>Digital Room Key 2<\/figcaption><\/figure>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Once the system recognizes the phone\/app, the page\/screen changes to a button you can use to actually open the door. God forbid that you’d be in a hurry, as this process takes much longer that it takes to pull a key out of your pocket and use it. If there was a rapist or robber on your tail, you’d be a victim before you could ever have the door open.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<figure><img src=\"images\/stories\/2018\/digital-hotel-key-03.png\" alt=\"Digital Room Key 3\" title=\"Digital Room Key 3\" \/><figcaption>Digital Room Key 3<\/figcaption><\/figure>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The challenging aspect of this feature is that this process only works when all of the intermediate parts work as well. When I got back from breakfast this morning, I opened the app and the app hung with a incompletely rendered screen. After poking around for a short while (closing and reopening the app a couple of times), the app finally told me that there was a problem and it was on the hotel’s end of things. Comforting information, but not even at all useful as I’m standing outside my room and can’t get in. Sigh.<\/p>\r\n<p>The problem eventually resolved itself and I could get into the room, but what options did I have in light of this failure? Call the hotel and hope they could get me into my room remotely? Would they even do that? Doubtful. I imagine they’d either send someone to the room with a key or I’d have to traipse down to the hotel lobby and get a physical key. Either way I’d probably have to prove who I am even though the app knows who I am and where I am.<\/p>\r\n<p>When I went to the gym this morning, a sign outside the door said I could find the fitness room key in the app. I’d not seen an option for that in the app, so I stood outside the fitness room for a few minutes fumbling around in the app until someone left and I could just go in their the opened door.<\/p>\r\n<p>It turns out that that little unlabeled blue key icon on the middle-top right of the screen opens some options for the key system. You can either access your room key or the key manager (whatever that is).<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<figure><img src=\"images\/stories\/2018\/digital-hotel-key-04.png\" alt=\"Digital Room Key 4\" title=\"Digital Room Key 4\" \/><figcaption>Digital Room Key 4<\/figcaption><\/figure>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>I only needed one key, so I had no idea what the key manager would be used for. I imagined I’d use it if I needed keys to two rooms (when I’m traveling with my family for example). Well, this inappropriately labeled option grants me access to other keys I’ll need when I’m staying at the hotel as you can see from the following figure.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<figure><img src=\"images\/stories\/2018\/digital-hotel-key-05.png\" alt=\"Digital Room Key 5\" title=\"Digital Room Key 5\" \/><figcaption>Digital Room Key 5<\/figcaption><\/figure>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>From a UX standpoint, the list of public keys should not be hidden away under a double sub-menu, those options belong on the bottom of the main key screen or under a separate, but easy to locate, tab on the key page. It should take one tap, or at worse two taps, to get to the fitness center key. In this app, it costs me three taps at a minimum, but only if I’m able to figure out in a hurry what that key icon means to me.<\/p>\r\n<p>Should that icon be a key, or something that says “other keys”? Which would enable the app user to get to other keys the most quickly? Yeah, the latter option. Even using a single key icon here is misleading, a simple icon with a stack of keys or a key ring would have helped me understand more quickly what that particular button was for.<\/p>\r\n<p>This system works, more or less, but could use some TLC (tender, loving care). This process is a great example of what happens when the person who designs and implements a system didn’t take the time to validate the UI with the everyday user. A little time with actual users would have helped them understand that the UI metaphors they selected simply didn’t work.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2018-02-17 19:27:57","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2018-05-18 19:18:21","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2018-02-17 19:33:45","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/common\\\/technology-870.png\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/common\\\/technology-870.png\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"3","ordering":"22","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"4863","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"506","asset_id":"659","title":"Editing Content in Screenshots","alias":"editing-content-in-screenshots","introtext":"<p>I take a lot of screenshots for my books, magazine articles, blog posts and product documentation. I’ve gotten pretty good at it, not because I have any special skills, instead its all about the tools I use.<\/p>\r\n<p>I use TechSmith’s Snagit tool on Windows and macOS; I’ve had licenses for this product for more years than I can count. Originally just for grabbing whole screen or window captures, the product’s matured a lot over the years and now offers some very flexible options for grabbing screenshots. I love the scrolling window options, although there’s a free Chrome plugin that does that as well.<\/p>\r\n<p>On Linux, I use the free Shutter application, it does everything I need it to do on Linux (which is usually just screenshots of terminal windows or application screens. If I need a full length browser window capture, I’ll usually just grab it from a Windows PC or Macintosh.<\/p>\r\n<p>One thing these tools don’t do is give you an easy way to hide or replace confidential information in screenshots. In Snagit I use the Snagit Editor to blur out or color-fill areas of an image to hide information I don’t want displayed in the screenshot. I sometimes use Corel’s PaintShop Pro to do the same thing, the only difference is whether i’m doing this as part of snapping a screenshot or simply editing a file later. These editing tasks, by the way, are the limit of my image retouching capabilities and I’m very glad that both tools make this easy.<\/p>\r\n<p>A feature I’d really like in Snagit, and its funny that I’ve never thought to tell them (TechSmith) this, is that I’d really like to be able to somehow select text elements or inputs on a screen and tell Snagit to blank them out or replace selected content during the screen capture. This way, I can capture my screens and blank out the private information in one seamless process instead of having to capture the image, open an editor, and make my changes. If you’re listening TechSmith, make this happen please?<\/p>\r\n<p>When working with screenshots of web pages or web applications, there is a relatively easy way to get change the content on the page before capturing the screenshot. I’ve noticed that a many&nbsp; writers don’t use this technique, so I thought I’d write about here and show you how it works.<\/p>\r\n<p>Using your browser’s developer tools, you can edit the content of any page. When you save your changes, those changes reflect immediately in the browser window. Then, when you take the screenshot, it shows whatever you want it to show on the page - hiding personal or confidential information you don’t want in the screenshot.<\/p>\r\n<p>Let me give you an example, since I work for Microsoft, I thought I’d use the Azure portal as an example. If you look at the following figure, you can see that the portal thinks my email address is joe dev at acmedynamite dot com and my user name is Joe Developer. Those aren’t my actual account details, I simply changed them before taking the screenshot.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n<figure><img src=\"images\/stories\/2018\/web-content-editing-01.png\" alt=\"Microsoft Azure Portal (modified)\" title=\"Microsoft Azure Portal (modified)\" \/><figcaption>Microsoft Azure Portal (modified)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\r\n<br \/>Let me show you how I did it.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Fixing URLs first<\/h2>\r\n<p>If you’re going to include the browser’s address bar in your screenshot as I’ve done in the previous example, you must make sure you edit the URL to remove any personally identifiable information (PII). If, for example, your site’s URL was something like this:<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/myimportantsite\/somefolder\/login&amp;user=someconfidentialusername\">http:\/\/myimportantsite\/somefolder\/login&amp;user=someconfidentialusername<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p>You’ll should edit out the PII, replacing it with useful, but non-confidential data. For example, many sites use Globally Unique Identifiers (GUID) in URLs to help the server identify the resources, and those often end up in URLs. If you look at the previous figure, you can see that the name for an automatically generated mobile app resource I created in Azure consists of the word mobile plus a GID. Since the full, internal name for resources you use in your app are something you won’t want others accessing, when I take a screenshot of a page loading that particular resource, I’ll simply let the page load, then edit the URL displayed in the browser, removing any information others can use to access that resource, before taking the screenshot. The edited URL doesn’t affect anything, all the existing links on the page will continue to work as expected.<\/p>\r\n<p>The only problem you’ll have is if you put focus on the browser’s address bar and press the enter key (triggering a load of the edited URL). Unless what you’ve typed is a valid URL, the browser won’t be able to find the page and you’ll see an error.<br \/>Another option is to take your browser screenshots omitting the browser chrome (including the address bar). When you do this, all you get is the rendered page, so you won’t need to worry about PII from the page address appearing in your screenshot.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Google Chrome Dev Tools<\/h2>\r\n<p>To ‘fix’ content on a page using the Chrome browser, open the browser to the page you want to screenshot. Next, open the Chrome developer tools (press Ctrl-Shift-I on Windows) then select the Elements tab (highlighted as step 1 in the following figure).<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n<figure><img src=\"images\/stories\/2018\/web-content-editing-02.png\" alt=\"Chrome Developer Tools\" title=\"Chrome Developer Tools\" \/><figcaption>Chrome Developer Tools<\/figcaption><\/figure>\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>Use search to locate the text you want to edit; press Ctrl-F on Windows or Command-F on macOS, then type the text you want to find on the page (step 2 in the figure). Chrome will highlight the selected text on the page (step 3 in the figure).<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n<figure><img src=\"images\/stories\/2018\/web-content-editing-03.png\" alt=\"Chrome Developer Tools: Searching Text\" title=\"Chrome Developer Tools: Searching Text\" \/><figcaption>Chrome Developer Tools: Searching Text<\/figcaption><\/figure>\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>Double-click on the selected text in the window as shown in the figure below, then type the text you want to replace the selected text.<\/p>\r\n<p>When you press the Enter key to end input, the page will update with your changes. Close the developer tools (Ctrl-Shift-I on Windows) and take your screenshot.<\/p>\r\n<p>You can also use the Chrome Inspector to locate the source for a particular element on the page. Click the icon highlighted in the following figure, then point to the page element you want to edit. The developer tools will highlight the selected text in the Elements pane - simply double-click on the text you want to edit and make your changes.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n<figure><img src=\"images\/stories\/2018\/web-content-editing-04.png\" alt=\"Chrome Developer Tools: Inspector\" title=\"Chrome Developer Tools: Inspector\" \/><figcaption>Chrome Developer Tools: Inspector<\/figcaption><\/figure>\r\n<\/p>\r\n<h2>Firefox Dev Tools<\/h2>\r\n<p>The Firefox developer tools work a little differently. Open the page you want to screenshot in Firefox, then press Ctrl-Shift-I to open the developer tools.

{"id":"508","asset_id":"661","title":"Building a Better Light Timer","alias":"building-a-better-light-timer","introtext":"<p>Make Magazine recently published an article of mine entitled Relays 4 Ways (they called it4 Ways to Control Electronic Relays, but I like my title better), you can find the article here: <a href=\"https:\/\/makezine.com\/2018\/03\/19\/control-electronic-relays.\">https:\/\/makezine.com\/2018\/03\/19\/control-electronic-relays.<\/a> This article was intended to accompany the Relays 4 Ways article as an example of a complete project using one of the components described in the article. For whatever reason, the folks at Make didn’t want this one, so I get to publish it here. Enjoy!<\/p>\r\n<h1>Introduction<\/h1>\r\n<p>If you’re a homeowner like me, you probably setup one or more light timers in your house whenever you leave for vacation. These devices are great, they turn any connected device (usually a light fixture) on and off on an adjustable schedule. Many devices let you set two on\/off time pairs (one in the morning and another at night for example) while more sophisticated (read expensive) devices let you set as many as you want.<\/p>\r\n<p>The problem with these timers is that you must manually set the on\/off times, plus you must ensure the device clock is set to the proper time every time you plug them in. If you’re out of town and the power goes off for any reason, when the power comes back on, the time will be off, and suddenly this inexpensive home security device turns your lights on and off at unexpected times instead of when you want it to, almost broadcasting to potential burglars that you’re not home.<\/p>\r\n<p>To help get around these limitations, its time for a better light timer. With this project, you’ll build a microcontroller-driven light timer that sets its own internal clock automatically via the Internet and turns the light on and off on an exact schedule. The project uses a Wi-Fi enabled Arduino device, and uses the device’s Wi-Fi connection to query an Internet time server for the current time. I used a real-time clock (RTC) module to store the time between sessions just in case the device can’t connect to the Internet to determine the current time on startup. Figure 1 shows the completed project.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2018\/better-light-timer-01.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 1 - The Better Light Timer<\/p>\r\n<p>What’s missing from the photo is power for the microcontroller; for this project I used a simple smartphone charger. To run this project, you’ll need two available power outlets, one for the light fixture, and the other to power the light timer.<\/p>\r\n<p>Within the project’s code, you’ll define an array of on\/off times that controls when the lights go on and off. I also added a push button to the project so you can turn the lights on\/off manually as needed.<\/p>\r\n<p>Note: Switching AC Power (110V in the US or 220V elsewhere) is dangerous; if you don’t do it right, you can harm yourself or even start a fire. To eliminate most of the risk in working with high voltages, this project uses a power pigtail to manage the power control aspect of the project. You’ll learn more about this component later.<\/p>\r\n<h1>Components<\/h1>\r\n<p>For this project, I used the following components:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Adafruit Feather M0 WiFi - ATSAMD21 + ATWINC1500 (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/product\/3010\">https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/product\/3010<\/a>).<\/li>\r\n<li>Adalogger FeatherWing - RTC + SD Add-on (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/product\/2922\">https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/product\/2922<\/a>).<\/li>\r\n<li>Feather Header Kit - 12-pin and 16-pin Female Header Set (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/product\/2886\">https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/product\/2886<\/a>).<\/li>\r\n<li>Feather Stacking Headers - 12-pin and 16-pin female headers (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/product\/2830\">https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/product\/2830<\/a>).<\/li>\r\n<li>Powerswitch Tail II (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/product\/268\">https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/product\/268<\/a>).<\/li>\r\n<li>SPST momentary push button (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00OJZPMD2\">https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00OJZPMD2<\/a>).<\/li>\r\n<li>5V 2.4A Switching Power Supply with 20AWG Micro USB Cable (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/product\/1995\">https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/product\/1995<\/a>).<\/li>\r\n<li>Project enclosure – For my project, I used the Hammond 1591M, a 3.3” X 2.2” X 0.8” enclosure (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00HKIQG3U\">https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00HKIQG3U<\/a>).<\/li>\r\n<li>An approximately 6 x 6 X ¾ piece of plywood, painted black (or your color of choice).<\/li>\r\n<li>4 #8 x ¾ wood screws (or equivalent).<\/li>\r\n<li>A few lengths of 20 or 22 gauge wire: black, red and some other color of your choice (I used blue).<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h1>About the Powerswitch Tail<\/h1>\r\n<p>The Powerswitch Tail (PT) is basically a box containing a relay with its switched connection wired across one of the conductors in an AC power plug. When you apply a specific voltage (normally between 3V and 5V) to the input connections on the PT (shown with two red wires connected to it in the figure) the relay triggers and AC current passes through the power cord. The PT is normally wired for normally open (NO) operation, but you can usually reconfigure the PT for NC operation as well.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Note<\/strong>: Refer to my article Relays 4 Ways for more information about relays.<\/p>\r\n<p>For this project, I used an Arduino-compatible microcontroller to apply that voltage (under program control, of course) to the PT input triggering the relay inside. When the microcontroller sends a voltage to the PT, its relay closes and AC power flows through, powering whatever is connected to it. When the microcontroller removes the voltage, the relay opens and power stops flowing through the PT.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Note<\/strong>: For this project, must provide two power sources, one to power the microcontroller (a smartphone charger providing 5V DC) and another to power the electrical device connected to the PT (110V or 220V AC depending on where you live).<\/p>\r\n<h1>Assembling the Hardware<\/h1>\r\n<p>The Feather MO Wi-Fi and FeatherWing boards are sold as stand-alone boards; even though they’re designed to stack on top of eachother, there’s no hardware included to connect them together. That’s why I added the female and stacking headers to the project. You’ll use the stacking headers with the FeatherWing board and the female headers with the Feather board as shown in Figure 2.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2018\/better-light-timer-02.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 2 – Microcontroller Boards and Header Components<\/p>\r\n<p>Mount the female headers on the top of the Feather; you’ll want the header sockets facing up so that you can mount the FeatherWing board on top of the Feather later. You can see what this looks like in Figure 3. The Feather boards don’t use the same number of header pins on each side of the board, so pay attention to which headers you put on each side. Flip the board over and solder the header pins, making sure that the headers are flush against the surface of the board.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2018\/better-light-timer-03.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 3 – Feather Components Stacked Together<\/p>\r\n<p>Next, insert the shorter posts from the stacking headers through the outside holes in the bottom of the FeatherWing board. If you look closely at the board (Figure 4), you’ll notice that the board has two sets of pin holes. The outside holes are for mounting the headers, the inside holes are for external connections to those pins; you’ll see how this works later. For now, make sure you place the headers in the correct set of holes; you won’t be able to connect the FeatherWing to the Feather board later if you make a mistake here.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2018\/better-light-timer-04.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 4 – Adalogger FeatherWing RTC Board<\/p>\r\n<p>With the headers in place, solder the pins in place on the top of the board. With this work done, you should be able to mount the FeatherWing board on top of the Feather Mo board as shown in Figure 3. Don’t do this yet, I’m just letting you know that you could do it if you wanted to. OK, if you’re impatient like me, or you just want to check your work, go ahead and connect the boards – just be careful separating them so you don’t bend the header pins.<\/p>\r\n<p>Mount the Powerswitch Tail on the board, positioning the device close to one side of the board. You’ll need to leave room for the enclosure, so position both on the board as you sort out the position for the PT. Make sure that the connections (the three holes shown face of the device) on the PT are facing the open\/empty portion of the board as shown in Figure 5. Drill pilot holes in the board where you want to mount the device, then use two screws to secure it to the board in the selected position.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2018\/better-light-timer-05.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 5 – Mounting the Powerswitch Tail<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Note<\/strong>: You’re going to mount the project’s enclosure on a board next to the PT, so do some planning now for where you want to make holes in the enclosure for the wires that pass through. You’re going to run the power cable through the enclosure to power the Feather and FeatherWing boards and you’ll also have two wires between the enclosure and the PT. For my version of this project, I ran the power cable through the right side of the enclosure (not shown in Figure 1) so both the light fixture power and enclosure power come in from the right side of the assembly.<\/p>\r\n<p>Using a drill or drill press, drill a hole in one end of the enclosure bottom for the power cord. The hole should be big enough for the power cable to fit in loosely. I always find that its easiest to drill this hole with the enclosure cover on, that way the plastic doesn’t bend as you put pressure on it with the drill. Cut through the hole to the top of the enclosure to make the opening U-shaped as shown in Figure 6. Make sure that the hole is low enough that the USB power cable can fit through the hole with the lid on.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2018\/better-light-timer-06.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 6 – Power Cable Hole<\/p>\r\n<p>Drill a hole in the side of the enclosure for the wires that will connect from the microcontroller to the PT as shown in Figure 7. I drilled two holes so I could run one wire through each, but you could easily use only one hole – just make sure its big enough for two wires.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2018\/better-light-timer-07.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 7 – Enclosure Holes for Wires to the Powertail<\/p>\r\n<p>Remove the nut and washer from the push button and select a drill bit that is only slightly larger than the opening in the washer. Using that drill bit, drill a hole in the enclosure lid for the push button. You’ll want to drill the hole with the lid attached to the enclosure (to keep the lid from flexing as you drill). Make sure you’re not drilling the hole too close to the edge as that will overlap the side of the enclosure. Position the button hole out of the way (lower-left or lower-right corner of the lid) as shown in Figure 8.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2018\/better-light-timer-08.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 8 – Push Button Hole in Enclosure Cover<\/p>\r\n<p>Solder two 3” wires to the push button connectors as shown in Figure 9. To keep any of the project component from shorting the button, I used shrink tubing to cover the soldered connections as shown in the figure.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2018\/better-light-timer-09.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 9 – Wiring the Push Button<\/p>\r\n<p>Mount the push button in the enclosure lid, making sure the button is on top of the lid. Use the washer and nut to secure the button in place.<\/p>\r\n<p>Cut three wires about 4 inches long: one black and two red. Solder one of the push button wires to the black wire and one of the red wires. At this point, you’ll have three wires soldered together as shown in the top of Figure 10. Use electrical tape or shrink tubing to cover the soldered connection.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2018\/better-light-timer-10.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 10 – Wiring Everything Together<\/p>\r\n<p>OK, before we go any further, lets talk about the connections we’ll make to the Feather board. Remember, we soldered female headers to the Feather, so there’s no open connections for us to use on that board. However, on the FeatherWing, there’s an extra set of connections I said we could use for external connections. Those connections connect to the corresponding connectors on the FeatherWing that are connected to the same pins on the Feather. Basically, those extra connectors are a pass-through to the corresponding pins on the Feather board.<\/p>\r\n<p>For this project, we need one input and one output: the input comes from the push button, and the output is the voltage connection to the PT. In a few minutes, we’re going to connect the output to the Feather’s A1 connection, and the push button to the Feather’s A2 connection. Take a moment and study Figure 11, it shows the Feather board pinouts. On the left side of the board you’ll see the three connections we’re going to use for this project: Ground (labeled GND in the figure), A1, and A2.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2018\/better-light-timer-11.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Figure 11 – Feather MO WiFi Pinout Diagram<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Note<\/strong>: Use Figure 10 as a visual reference for the next three steps.<\/p>\r\n<p>Solder the open end of the black wire to the GND pin on the FeatherWing board. If you look at Figure 4, the connection you want is the 4th in from the left on the lower half of the board.<\/p>\r\n<p>Solder one end of the extra red wire to pin A1. On Figure 4, this is the 6th connector from the left on the lower half of the board.<\/p>\r\n<p>Solder the free wire from the push button to pin A2. On Figure 4, this is the 7th connector from the left on the lower half of the board.<\/p>\r\n<p>When you’re done, you should have two red wires not connected to anything, and everything else connected to the FeatherWing. These two red wires are what connects the Feather board to the PT.<\/p>\r\n<p>Mount the FeatherWing on the Feather. To do this, just align the pins on the FeatherWing with the header sockets on the Feather and push them together gently.<br \/>Select a drill bit that matches the thread width of the wood screws. Drill two holes in the bottom of the enclosure. Drill slightly smaller pilot holes in the board, then use the two remaining wood screws to secure the enclosure to the board.<\/p>\r\n<p>Push the two red wires through the hole (or holes) in the side of the enclosure facing the PT. Connect the wires to the appropriate connectors on the PT. You’ll have to look at the instructions for your PT to determine which ones to use.<\/p>\r\n<p>At this point, everything is wired and connected, its time to download and install the code.<\/p>\r\n<p>The project’s code can be found at <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/arduino-rtc-relay-static.\">https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/arduino-rtc-relay-static.<\/a> To get the code, you can download a zip file containing everything and extract it in a folder on your system.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you have Git installed (macOS comes with it installed by default, on Windows you’ll have to install it yourself from <a href=\"https:\/\/git-scm.com\">https:\/\/git-scm.com<\/a>), you can download it by opening a terminal window, navigating to a folder where you want to extract the project’s code, and executing the following command:<\/p>\r\n<p>git clone <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/arduino-rtc-relay-static\">https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/arduino-rtc-relay-static<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p>Follow the instructions to setup the Arduino IDE found in the Feather tutorial at <a href=\"https:\/\/learn.adafruit.com\/adafruit-feather-m0-adalogger\/setup.\">https:\/\/learn.adafruit.com\/adafruit-feather-m0-adalogger\/setup.<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p>Before you can use the project’s code, you must first configure it. The application needs to know the settings for your Wi-Fi network so it can connect to the internet and get the current time. The application also needs to know when to turn your lights on and off. Lets start with the Wi-Fi configuration first.<\/p>\r\n<p>The project’s Wi-Fi configuration settings are stored in a file called wi-fi-config.h. When you open the file in the IDE, you should see the following:<\/p>\r\n<pre>\/\/ Populate the defines below with the settings for your Wi-Fi network<br \/>\/\/ Network SSID (name)<br \/>#define wifi_ssid \"\"<br \/>\/\/ SSID password (use for WPA, or use as key for WEP)<br \/>#define wifi_pass \"\"<\/pre>\r\n<p>Populate the wifi_ssid and wifi_pass values with the appropriate values for your network. The wifi_ssid refers to the network name for your Wi-Fi network. This is the value you’ll see when you open your smartphone’s Wi-Fi settings and your network appears in the list of available networks. The wifi_pass value refers to the password you need to connect to the Wi-Fi network specified in wifi_ssid.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, if your local Wi-Fi network is called MyNetwork and the password for MyNetwork is “some ridiculous password” then your wi-fi-config.h file should look like this:<\/p>\r\n<pre>\/\/ Populate the defines below with the settings for your Wi-Fi network<br \/>\/\/ Network SSID (name)<br \/>#define wifi_ssid \"MyNetwork\"<br \/>\/\/ SSID password (use for WPA, or use as key for WEP)<br \/>#define wifi_pass \"some ridiculous password\"<\/pre>\r\n<p>Save your changes to the file before continuing.<\/p>\r\n<p>Next, open the project’s rtc-relay-static.ino file. Near the top of the file, you should see a constant definition for your local time zone:<\/p>\r\n<pre>\/\/Set the time zone using the time zones listed in constants.h.<br \/>\/\/You'll have to manually switch the device from standard time to daylight<br \/>\/\/time during the summer if you live in an area that observes daylight time.<br \/>const int timeZone = EST;<\/pre>\r\n<p>Right now, the application is configured for Eastern time zone (that’s where I live). If you live in a different time zone, change this value to one of the available options in the constants.h file. I didn’t list all the time zone options in this file, so if your time zone isn’t listed, you’re going to have to add it to the file before making the change to the timeZone value in the rtc-relay-static.ino file.<\/p>\r\n<p>Finally, the app knows when to turn the lights on and off based on settings defined in the slots array shown below:<\/p>\r\n<p>\/\/Populate the following variable with the number of rows in the slots array<br \/>\/\/I'm doing this way because Arduino doesn't have an easy way to determine<br \/>\/\/the size of an array at runtime, especially multidimensional arrays.<br \/>#define NUMSLOTS 2<\/p>\r\n<pre>\/\/Use the Slots array to define when the relay(s) go on and off<br \/>\/\/Slots array values: {onTime, offTime };<br \/>\/\/ Examples:<br \/>\/\/ Turn the relay on at 6:00 AM, turn it off 8:00 AM<br \/>\/\/ { 600, 800 },<br \/>\/\/ Turn the relay on at 5:00 PM turn it off at 11:00 PM.<br \/>\/\/ {1700, 2300}<br \/>\/\/ Turn the relay on at 5:30 AM, turn the relay off at 7:00 AM.<br \/>\/\/ {530, 700}<br \/>int slots[NUMSLOTS][2] = {<br \/> { 600, 800 },<br \/> {2000, 2300} <br \/> \/\/BE SURE TO UPDATE THE NUMSLOTS CONSTANT IF YOU ADD\/REMOVE<br \/> \/\/ROWS FROM THIS ARRAY<br \/>};<\/pre>\r\n<p>Currently, the application is configured to turn the lights on at 6 AM and turn them off at 8 AM. Later in the day, it will turn the lights on again at 8 PM and off at 11 PM. Do you see that in the code? Hint: time values are stored in 24 hour format.<\/p>\r\n<p>Right now, the slots array is a two-dimensional array with two rows and two values for each row. Each row consists of an on time and an off time. You can have as many on\/off times (rows) defined as you want. The C language on the Arduino platform doesn’t support dynamically sized arrays, so when you add or remove a row to this array, you must also change the value in NUMSLOTS to correspond to the number of rows in the array.<\/p>\r\n<p>Make whatever changes you want to the on\/off times, then save your changes to the file. Use the Arduino IDE to load the application to the Feather board, connect the power supply to the Feather board, secure the top on the enclosure, and you’re ready to go.<\/p>\r\n<p>To test the assembly:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Plug the Powerswitch Tail into a wall outlet.<\/li>\r\n<li>Plug a light fixture or other electric appliance to the other end of the Powerwsitch Tail.<\/li>\r\n<li>Plug the project’s power supply into another outlet.<\/li>\r\n<li>Give the hardware some time to initialize and connect to the network.<\/li>\r\n<li>Push the push button for about a half-second or more to toggle the Powerswitch Tail relay manually.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>That’s it, you’re done! The project code is the most sophisticated Arduino code I’ve written. Spend some time reading through the code to see how it verifies its configuration and that it has the correct time and knows how to connect to the Internet to update it.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"41","created":"2018-03-24 19:07:39","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2018-05-18 19:10:10","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2018-03-29 23:55:16","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/common\\\/iot-870.png\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/common\\\/iot-870.png\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"12","ordering":"10","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"5421","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

{"id":"510","asset_id":"663","title":"Super Short Tutorials Failure","alias":"super-short-tutorials-failure","introtext":"<p>I subscribe to several of the few remaining technical magazines in the technology and Maker spaces. &nbsp;I’ve noticed recently that these magazines publish really, really short tutorials. I imagine they do this in order to deliver more articles in a single publication, but the end result is that these tutorials are relatively useless from a learning standpoint.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now, don’t get me wrong, there are a lot of tutorials in these magazines.<\/p>\r\n<p>My issue is that, for many of them, they set an arbitrary length limitation (usually 2 or 4 pages) for the article, no matter how complicated the topic. When this happens, the writer has to deliberately omit a lot of details about what’s going on with the project.<\/p>\r\n<p>I’ve found that these short articles have the following issues:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Abrupt introduction - for many of the articles, the author skips completely describing what it is you’re building. If you’re several paragraphs into a tutorial and you don’t yet know exactly what you’re learning, is it your fault, or the author’s?<\/li>\r\n<li>Commands without reason - so many times you’ll be working through a Linux tutorial and you’ll be instructed to execute certain terminal commands without any explanation of why you’re executing these commands. Without any information about why you’re doing certain steps, how exactly are you learning?<\/li>\r\n<li>Missing troubleshooting information - great, the author’s told you what command to execute and is already off describing the next step. What if the command doesn’t work? What if the output you see is different than what the author tells you you should see? How exactly are you going to be able to complete the project? With every step should come a simple but useful description of what could go wrong. If it works, the reader can quickly skip ahead to the next step. If it doesn’t work, the reader has what he or she needs to recover from encountered errors.<\/li>\r\n<li>Forced images - One magazine I’ve written for demanded a specific number of images for every page of content. I get it, eye candy makes the articles more pleasant to look at, and breaks up the text. What happens if you’re describing something that doesn’t have images (like programming or language concepts)? This causes many authors to make something up, create images just so you’ll have them to look at. The best example of this for me is Raspberry Pi tutorials where authors include screenshots of terminal windows - which are completely illegible on the printed page. Publisher requirement met, but user value not met.<\/li>\r\n<li>If the author’s any good at organizing his or her thoughts and writing, and you’re any good at following instructions, then chances are you’ll finish the process with a discernible result. However, will you have actually learned anything? &nbsp;The instructions work for the specific hardware and\/or software setup, but will you be able to apply what you did to other scenarios? I doubt it.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>These authors are working for very little, or no money, but are trying to share their knowledge and experience. I love that! That’s one reason why open source software is so spectacular. We need to be vocal about our wishes here. Let us learn as much as possible from these author’s great work. Demand that these magazines relinquish control and let the writers write complete tutorials. During the editing process, trim out the extra and unneeded stuff, but let the complete description of the process be free!<\/p>\r\n<p>Photo by <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/photos\/cJkVMAKDYl0?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Charisse Kenion<\/a> on <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/search\/photos\/magazine?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Unsplash<\/a><\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2018-05-08 01:13:13","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2018-05-08 01:13:13","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2018-05-08 01:13:13","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/common\\\/magazines-870.png\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/common\\\/magazines-870.png\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"1","ordering":"20","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"4984","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"511","asset_id":"667","title":"SiteLock’s Deceptive Sales Tactics","alias":"sitelock-s-deceptive-sales-tactics","introtext":"<p>I’m a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sitelock.com\/\">SiteLock <\/a>customer; my hosting provider offers the service at a discount, so I signed up for it on several of the sites I manage. My ISP uses SiteLock to scan customer accounts for malware, and, of course, SiteLock tries to upsell me on more rigorous scanning.<\/p>\r\n<p>A few weeks ago, I received an unsolicited email from Justin McCulloch, a SiteLock Security Consultant, informing me that they’d detected a problem with the site. Here’s what he said in the email:<\/p>\r\n<p>“My name is Justin and we are partnered with Fatcow, we do all of the web security for your website. We were notified that you have some serious issues that are present which can harm your website. We want to go ahead and get these issues addressed as soon as possible. Please reach me at my contact information below.”<\/p>\r\n<p>Here's the email:<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"images\/stories\/2018\/site-lock-justin-mcculloch.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>If they’re partnered with FatCow, how is it that he doesn’t know that FatCow spells its name with a capital C?<\/p>\r\n<p>Holy crikey - “serious issues”? That sounded ominous, I’d better look into this.<\/p>\r\n<p>Recognizing that the email message didn’t contain any information I could use to understand which of my accounts was affected by these “serious issues”, and what those “serious issues” were, I quickly sent off a reply email asking for more details. Rather than respond to my email, he called my home office number 4 out of 5 business days every week for two weeks. In one of his messages, he finally indicated which account(s) had the \"serious issues\".<\/p>\r\n<p>I know that my ISP periodically scans for malware, and creates a text file in a folder on my account’s server listing all of the issues it discovered during the scan. I quickly fired up my trusty FTP client, navigated to my server, and looked for the file in the file system. Nope, nothing there.<\/p>\r\n<p>Both sites he mentioned are WordPress sites, and I know that I have malware tools running on both of them, I logged into the WordPress admin for each site and checked scan results for both. Nothing there either.<\/p>\r\n<p>I finally made it home for a couple of days and called Justin McCulloch at SiteLock. He wasn’t in, so I left a voicemail message for him and he quickly called back. When I asked him about the “serious issues” on my accounts, he began explaining to me how SiteLock worked. I interrupted him and told him that as a professional software developer and a SiteLock customer, I knew how they work and what they do.<\/p>\r\n<p>He then started explaining to me that the scanner that FatCow offers only scans a certain number of pages of a site, and since my site was ‘larger’ than the number of pages they were scanning, many of my pages were not being scanned.<\/p>\r\n<p>This is the “serious issues” he’s been pestering me about?<\/p>\r\n<p>I’ve already told you that the sites in question, the ones with “serious issues” are WordPress sites. I know their scanner scans the WordPress files looking for malware, so it doesn’t matter how many ‘pages’ my site has, if they’ve scanned the code, they’ve scanned most everything. Everything else is just data in a database.<\/p>\r\n<p>One of the sites with “serious issues” is a simple blog accessed by just a few people. I’m the only one who has admin access to the site, and I haven’t updated the site in a really long time, I knew that it didn’t matter how many pages I had, the full site had been scanned by SiteLock.<\/p>\r\n<p>The other site with “serious issues” is a site I just created for a local fundraiser. I’d done nothing except install WordPress, so the site has no pages, no posts, no plugins, nothing. No risk there either.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, all this stress and concern over the “serious issues” with the site was nothing more than an opportunity for Justin McCulloch at SiteLock to try to sell me additional services.<\/p>\r\n<p>I explained to Justin McCulloch from SiteLock that I was a technical guy who understood the risk, and that I didn’t need additional services from SiteLock. He continued to press, even trying to tell me that if I didn’t address these “serious issues” now, it would be much more expensive to fix them later. There were no “serious issues” my sites don’t have any malware. As I tried to explain this to him (probably rather impolitely) he reacted by hanging up on me.<\/p>\r\n<p>I quickly looked up the main phone number for SiteLock and gave them a call. I was able to connect with a customer service manager and tell my story. Obviously this isn’t SiteLock’s normal operating procedure, I assume there are many SiteLock employees who wouldn’t consider lying to customers in order to get more business from them, I just happened to get one who didn’t mind lying about “serious issues” with my site in order to scare me into buying more services.<\/p>\r\n<p>I’m considering cancelling my SiteLock services. This experience didn’t help, but I also had a very long period where my primary site (this one) was regularly hacked and SiteLock wasn’t able to do anything about it. SiteLock has a product I could buy that probably would have blocked many of the hacks I experienced, but as a lone developer writing about his projects, I can’t afford the $600 or o per year I’d have to pay for their more robust scanner and firewall. I was able to finally lock down my site to block the hacks, so I’m OK.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2018-06-19 23:32:43","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2018-06-19 23:48:21","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2018-06-19 23:32:43","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/common\\\/fotolia-hacked-small.png\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/common\\\/fotolia-hacked-small.png\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"3","ordering":"19","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"4285","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"512","asset_id":"668","title":"Microsoft Announces Plans to Acquire GitHub","alias":"microsoft-buys-github","introtext":"<p>A few weeks ago, Microsoft announced its intention to acquire GitHub, and I don’t understand what the fuss is all about.<\/p>\r\n<p>Note: I work for Microsoft, but this post is NOT official communication from Microsoft. Its merely my personal insights on a topic that I find interesting. I am not authorize to speak on Microsoft’s behalf on this topic, so do not construe anything you read here as an official statement by my employer.<\/p>\r\n<p>GitHub is a great platform for sharing code. I use it extensively for personal coding projects, work related stuff (most of Microsoft’s docs are published through GitHub), and my past work with the open source Apache Cordova project.<\/p>\r\n<p>Looking at the different articles and posts on the Internet, it’s clear that there are two camps out there; one that things Microsoft owning GitHub is a good thing, and the other that thinks it’s the worst, possible, thing, ever!<\/p>\r\n<p>The first group is right, Microsoft buying GitHub is a good thing. Those foretelling the demise of GitHub at Microsoft’s hands are wrong, and are so busy looking far into the past that they can’t see the open world they live in.<\/p>\r\n<p>Yes, Microsoft’s Steve Ballmer did say that Open Source was a cancer. We all heard that (and most of us cringed when we saw or read it). We all, I hope, know that Ballmer was wrong, absolutely wrong. At the time he said that, the software business was a commercially licensed software world. There were open source companies, but enterprises and consumers still bought licenses for their most important apps (the ones they use the most, or the ones they ran their businesses on). We don’t live in that world anymore, and we haven’t for a while now.<\/p>\r\n<p>Open Source won!<\/p>\r\n<p>Software companies (like Microsoft) still exist, but the most large companies run their more modern software on open source stacks. Software companies adapted and switched to a pay per use approach (cloud services, SaaS, and PaaS) or they offer additional capabilities or support for open source solutions. There’s still a lot of for fee apps out there, but the world has switched to open source for so much software nowadays that it’s hard to imagine paying big dollars for software like we did in the past.<\/p>\r\n<p>Microsoft has fully embraced open source. They’re the biggest publisher of open source software on GitHub. Visual Studio Code, a free, open source developer editor from Microsoft is the most popular editor used by developers worldwide. Don’t forget the Monaco editor (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Microsoft\/monaco-editor\">https:\/\/github.com\/Microsoft\/monaco-editor<\/a>) the editor at the core of Visual Studio Code is open source and available for anyone to use any way they want to.<\/p>\r\n<p>Those naysayers who are freaking out about our pending purchase (Microsoft hasn’t purchased GitHub yet), do they realize that Monaco is likely used in many products that compete with Microsoft products and Microsoft doesn’t care?<\/p>\r\n<p>Back to the timing of the acquisition, Microsoft was very clear that it’s trying to close the deal by the end of the year. What that means is that Microsoft doesn’t own GitHub. Microsoft signed a letter of intent to purchase the company, and the two companies are going to work diligently over the next 6 months or so to make that happen, but NOTHING HAPPENS at GitHub until the deal closes. Nat Friedman will be CEO of GitHub, but he isn’t now, and he legally can’t direct GitHub employees to do anything.<\/p>\r\n<p>To all those backward looking developers who publicly announced the closure of their GitHub accounts, why? GitHub is the exact same company it was on the Monday before the Microsoft announcement; exactly the same. Why the rush to close your account? In a fit of pique, you’re going to abandon the tool you use to manage the source code for all of your projects just because of something you think may happen in six months or so?<\/p>\r\n<p>I know Microsoft will fulfill its commitment to leave GitHub alone, why not wait to see that proven? I know Nat Friedman will work very hard to earn the community’s trust, why not stick around to see that? &nbsp;Did the world end Monday? Nope. Will the world end when this deal closes? Not likely. Calm down, take a breath, and watch what happens before you make a decision.<\/p>\r\n<p>If Microsoft closes the deal, makes some changes at GitHub, and you don’t like the changes, feel free to move on. But until then, listen to people who really know Microsoft and know how the company feels about Open Source. Open source isn’t a cancer, it’s the backbone of the technology world and something Microsoft fully supports.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2018-06-28 21:19:02","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2018-06-29 20:42:20","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2018-06-28 21:19:02","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/2018\\\/microsoft-github.png\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/2018\\\/microsoft-github.png\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"4","ordering":"18","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"5173","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

Control Everything is now <a href=\"http:\/\/ncd.io\">National Control Devices<\/a>, and the small and simple Photon Relay board is now the <a href=\"https:\/\/store.ncd.io\/product\/1-channel-1-amp-spdt-signal-relay-board-7-gpio-with-iot-interface\/\">1-Channel 1-Amp SPDT Signal Relay Board + 7 GPIO with IoT Interface<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>Just in case you’re interested, here’s the specs (from the NCD website) on the new board:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>1-Channel Relay Controller with IoT Interface<\/li>\r\n<li>7-Channel Programmable Digital Input\/Output (GPIO)<\/li>\r\n<li>Compatible with Electron, Photon, Bluz, or RedBear<\/li>\r\n<li>Adaptable to Onion, PyCom, Raspberry Pi, Arduino<\/li>\r\n<li>MCP23008 I2C Controlled Mechanical DPDT Relay<\/li>\r\n<li>Choose 1, 3, or 5-Amp DPDT Signal Switching Relays<\/li>\r\n<li>World’s Most Expandable Controller with I2C Expansion Port<\/li>\r\n<li>Wireless Remote Operation with Key Fob Expansion Option<\/li>\r\n<li>ESP8266 and USB IoT Interface Modules are Also Available<\/li>\r\n<li>IFTTT Firmware Available for Internet Relay Control<\/li>\r\n<li>Example Libraries Available on GitHub<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h2>Missing Documentation<\/h2>\r\n<p>As you can see, one of the features of this board is the GPIO ports it exposes along with a relay, they give me the ability to control some LEDs along with switching the relay. You can also use those GPIO ports as inputs, but for my project, I wanted to use them as outputs (driving two LEDs).<\/p>\r\n<p>As I started assembling my hardware, I noticed that a lot of information you need to interact with the relay board is missing from the product’s sparse documentation. Specifically, there was no information available on how to use the GPIO functionality on that board.<\/p>\r\n<p>I let the folks at NCD know, and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ControlEverythingCom\/NCD1Relay\/issues\/3\">asked them to update the docs<\/a>, but what I heard back was “Honestly I wrote these libraries a long time ago and that functionality just wasn't something I thought of at the time. We release these libraries to the public for free so we really don't make a whole lot for developing them which limits the amount of time we as a business can invest in updating them for feature additions.” &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>So, basically, they’re saying it’s not worth their effort to update the docs so you’ll know how use their products. Nice!<\/p>\r\n<p>I fixed some typos in their docs and submitted pull requests, but so far they’ve not accepted them or even responded to let me know that they won’t use them. Sigh.<\/p>\r\n<p>With that in mind, I thought I’d fill in some of the blanks in the docs so if you buy one of these boards, you’ll actually be able to use it to its full extent in your project.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Mounting the Photon<\/h2>\r\n<p>The original relay board only supported the Photon, so it was easy to mount the photon to the relay board. The board came with markings indicating which end of the photon went where.<\/p>\r\n<p>The NCD documentation doesn’t include any instructions for how to connect the Photon to the relay board, nor are there any product pictures using the Photon. The new relay boards accommodate a wider variety of microcontrollers (adding the Electron, Bluz, or RedBear) which have more pins (connectors) than the Photon, so the relay board has more sockets than the Photon has pins.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, if you <a href=\"https:\/\/media.ncd.io\/sites\/2\/20170721142843\/MCP23008-PEIO7R1G5LE_1.png\">look at this image<\/a> (which shows a microcontroller I don’t recognize), it’s using all the sockets. The photon aligns with the far right of the board (as shown in the figure) with the Photon’s power connector pointing off the end of the board. When you mount the board, make sure the first pins on the board insert in the sockets at the edge of the board. When you’re done, there will be a bunch of sockets open to the left of the Photon.<\/p>\r\n<p>Normally I’d simply take a picture of my hardware, but I’ve already completed assembly of my project and I’d have to take it apart to grab a photo. I had a reason to take the project apart, so here’s a photo that shows how the Photon fits on the relay board.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"images\/stories\/2018\/ncd-relay-particle.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<h2>Using the GPIO Ports<\/h2>\r\n<p>Now, here’s where it gets funny. NCD calls the single relay board the NCD1, the 4-relay board is the NCD4, and the 8-relay board is the, wait for it…, the NCD8. The <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ControlEverythingCom\/NCD1Relay\">software library for the NCD1<\/a> exposes a single set of methods for interacting with the relay: <code>turnOnRelay<\/code>, <code>turnOffRelay<\/code>, and <code>toggleRelay<\/code>. Since the relay board only has 1 relay, those methods don’t even require a parameter to indicate which relay you’re turning on\/off or toggling. You simply call the method and it does what you want with the single relay on the board.<\/p>\r\n<p>Remember the 7 GPIO channels? &nbsp;Well, the library only exposes methods you can use to read values from the GPIO channels used as inputs. &nbsp;You Photon firmware can call <code>readInputStatus<\/code> and pass it the number (1-7) of the GPIO port you want to read, and it will return a value indicating the value read from the port. Your project’s firmware can also call <code>readAllInputs<\/code> which returns the status of all of the GPIO ports represented as binary values in a byte of data.<\/p>\r\n<p>Exciting stuff, right?<\/p>\r\n<p>I’m not an electrical engineer, but what I imagine they did was isolate the relay hardware from the microcontroller using the MCP23008 chip which is 8 port IC2 I\/O expander. They wanted to ‘talk’ to the relay board using IC2, then have special hardware on the board that sends voltage to the relay when the right command comes in. The relay board has 7 available GPIO ports because, on the single relay board, there are 7 unused I\/O ports on the MCP23008.<\/p>\r\n<p>Having 7 GPIO ports available is merely the side effect of using the MCP23008 to control the relay.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, since the board’s library doesn’t support anything but the ability to read data from the GPIO ports, what do you do?<\/p>\r\n<p>Well, the 4 and 8-relay boards have different libraries that enable you to control more than one relay using the <code>turnOnRelay<\/code>, <code>turnOffRelay<\/code>, and <code>toggleRelay<\/code> methods. To drive an output voltage on the GPIO ports, you have to use the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ControlEverythingCom\/NCD4Relay\">NCD4<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ControlEverythingCom\/NCD8Relay\">NCD8<\/a> libraries in your project.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, if you want to drive a voltage output on the GPIO ports, all you have to do is call <code>turnOnRelay<\/code> and pass it the GPIO port number. Now, the relay eats up the first GPIO port (on the NCD1 anyway), so your GPIO numbers are shifted as shown in the following table:<\/p>\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr style=\"border-width: 1px; border-color: #000000; text-align: center;\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p>Method Input<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>NCD1<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>NCD4<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>NCD8<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr style=\"border-width: 1px; border-color: #000000;\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p>1<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p>Relay (only)<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p>Relay 1<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p>Relay 1<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr style=\"border-width: 1px; border-color: #000000;\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p>2<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p>GPIO 1<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p>Relay 2<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p>Relay 2<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr style=\"border-width: 1px; border-color: #000000;\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p>3<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p>GPIO 2<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p>Relay 3<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p>Relay 3<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr style=\"border-width: 1px; border-color: #000000;\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p>4<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p>GPIO 3<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p>Relay 4<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p>Relay 4<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr style=\"border-width: 1px; border-color: #000000;\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p>5<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p>GPIO 4<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p>GPIO 1<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p>Relay 5<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr style=\"border-width: 1px; border-color: #000000;\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p>6<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p>GPIO 5<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p>GPIO 2<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p>Relay 6<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr style=\"border-width: 1px; border-color: #000000;\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p>7<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p>GPIO 6<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p>GPIO 3<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p>Relay 7<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr style=\"border-width: 1px; border-color: #000000;\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p>8<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p>GPIO 7<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p>GPIO 4<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p>Relay 8<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n<p>Are you seeing the pattern here?

{"id":"514","asset_id":"670","title":"Protecting Data in a URL","alias":"protecting-data-in-a-url","introtext":"<p>A while back, I created a remote <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/particle-garage-door-controller\">garage door opener<\/a> project using the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.particle.io\/\">Particle platform<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Particle Platform (devices and cloud services) enables developers to write code running on an Arduino-compatible device that can be remotely executed via a cloud service. Connect a Photon and a relay to a garage opener and you have the gist of my project.<\/p>\r\n<p>One of the cool features of the project’s mobile app is that it enables app users to generate a single-use key, deploy it to the garage door opener, then send a URL to someone who requires access to the garage. The feature is something I hacked together and it works pretty well (I’ve been using it in my house for years). The system only supports one single-use code at a time, but when you need to get someone into your house when you’re not around, it works great.<\/p>\r\n<p>I’ve been working on an update to the project, and one of the things I wanted to do is protect the homeowner’s private information in the URL sent to others. In order to use the Particle platform from an application, you must have the Particle user’s Access Token plus the device ID for the Particle Photon attached to the garage door opener. For the single-use code scenario, you also need the single-use code.<\/p>\r\n<p>For my project, I basically built a web application that has the user’s configuration hard-coded in the app’s configuration. The mobile app that generates the single-use code merely builds a URL pointing to a hosted web app and passes in the single-use code on the URL. The hosted web app pulls the access token and device ID from it’s local config file, and it’s all ready to go. The problem with this approach is that it requires the user to modify a web app and host it somewhere in order to deploy the project. Now, there are a few places where you can host a web application for free, but it’s still too complicated for many users to configure, setup and deploy the web app. I needed a better way.<\/p>\r\n<p>I decided to build my own hosted web page to use for the garage opener project, I’d remove the configuration from the web application code and just include the three required configuration settings in the URL generated by my project’s mobile app.<\/p>\r\n<p>As I started thinking through the implementation of this approach, I quickly realized that I didn’t want to pass the Access Token, Device ID, and Single-Use code in clear text in the generated URL. Nope, I needed a way to encrypt those values in the URL. Otherwise, anyone snooping traffic could grab those values and hack their way into the garage. Granted it's not a high risk that someone will be snooping your garage door opener traffic, but I’d rather be safe than sorry, and this gave me an interesting computing problem to solve (my favorite).<\/p>\r\n<p>I’m not a native mobile developer, so the mobile app I’d deliver would be an Apache Cordova, Ionic, or React Native app. I knew there were encryption libraries for JavaScript, and I set about finding the best one to use for my project. I realized through that encrypting the data in an app wasn’t safe, a knowledgeable user could tear apart my code and hack the system. The encryption key, and encryption algorithm would be in the code, so that’s not even close to being secure. That wouldn’t work.<\/p>\r\n<p>I poked and prodded at several potential solutions, but none panned out. I wanted (needed) this architecture to be both simple and secure, and nothing good came to mind. I started asking a colleague about possible options for encrypting the data using JavaScript and he quickly suggested using a serverless function to encrypt the data.<\/p>\r\n<p>I tried to quickly discount this approach because I didn’t want to pay for compute in the cloud, but then he reminded me that I could use Azure Functions for free (Microsoft offers Azure Functions in a free tier for a ridiculous number of function calls per month [more than I think I’ll ever use for this project]).<\/p>\r\n<p>To prove the validity of this solution, I logged into my personal Azure account, created an Azure App Service Functions instance and got to work. Before long I had it working; it was quick, simple, and a rather elegant solution to my problem. The purpose of this article is to show you how I did it in order to help others who may have this same problem.<\/p>\r\n<p>For my implementation, I created two services:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>setSingleUseCode<\/code><\/li>\r\n<li><code>pushButtonWithCode<\/code><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>The <code>setSingleUseCode<\/code> function:<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Gets the Particle Access Token and Device ID in the body of an HTTP request.<\/li>\r\n<li>Generates a single use code<\/li>\r\n<li>Calls my project’s Particle API to register the single-use code with the selected device (by the Device ID passed to the function)<\/li>\r\n<li>Once the function knows that the single-use code was successfully registered with the Photon device, it:<ol>\r\n<li>Creates a JSON object containing Access Token, Device ID, and Single-use code.<\/li>\r\n<li>Encrypts the JSON object using my super special, secret encrypting key.<\/li>\r\n<li>Builds a URL for my hosted web application, appending the encrypted data as a parameter in the URL.<\/li>\r\n<li>Returns the URL to the calling application.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>The calling application copies the URL to the clipboard, enabling the user to open and email or SMS message, and paste the URL in the message body. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>When the receiving user invokes the URL, my hosted web application opens, then:<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Validates the format of the URL (that the encrypted data is there).<\/li>\r\n<li>Displays a button the user clicks\/taps to open the garage door.<\/li>\r\n<li>When the user clicks\/taps the button, the application invokes the <code>pushButtonWithCode<\/code> Azure function, passing it the encrypted data from the URL.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>The <code>pushButtonWithCode<\/code> function:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Decrypts the data from the request<\/li>\r\n<li>Uses the decrypted Access Token, Device ID, and single-use code to call the Particle Cloud and invoke a function on the selected Particle Photon device.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>That’s it, a very simple and elegant solution to my problem. Implementation-wise, it’s a couple of hundred lines of JavaScript code (most of it shared across the two functions). Performance is great, and my only cost is a few cents a month to pay for the Azure storage used to store information about my functions.<\/p>\r\n<p>I’m still working through what I want to do with this thing. My ultimate goal is to make this whole project public and share the code. I’ll let you know when that happens.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"41","created":"2018-07-01 23:23:37","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2018-07-01 23:23:37","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2018-07-02 16:00:00","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/common\\\/code-870.png\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/common\\\/code-870.png\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"1","ordering":"8","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"5113","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

Unfortunately, the NC Lottery created two major issues that affect my ability to actually do that. For some bizarre reason, NC lottery tickets have two barcodes on them. One is for their Lucke Rewards Program (their typo in the name, not mine), and the other is so the vendor (and the app) can check to see if the ticket is a winner.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2018\/nc-lottery-1.png\" alt=\"NC Lottery App #1\" width=\"293\" height=\"602\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Note: I imagine the reason there are two barcodes on the ticket is because North Carolina is the only state that has the poorly named Lucke Rewards program, so there’s no way for them to use the same barcode for both. Unfortunately, the barcode scanner on your phone (its camera) you’ll use to check to see if your ticket is a winner can’t read the barcode when there’s two barcodes on the ticket. You can scan the top barcode (toward the middle of the ticket) to collect your rewards, but when you try to check to see if you’re a winner, the scanner fails most every time.<\/p>\r\n<p>To get around this, you have to cover the upper barcode with a piece of paper or cardboard before attempting a scan. How stupid is that?<\/p>\r\n<p>Notice the SCAN NOW button in the figure. It’s a smartphone app screen, right? Notice how the button’s too small to tap with your finger? The same is true for the collecting rewards section of the app as shown in the following figure. Poor design, not paying attention at all that users will be doing this on a smartphone.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2018\/nc-lottery-2.png\" alt=\"NC Lottery App #2\" width=\"293\" height=\"602\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>The second major issue with the app is that the designer, or the development team that crafted the app didn’t seem to consider the use case where a user needs to check more than one ticket at a time. They seemed to just assume you’d check a ticket every draw day, rather than collect them, and check them all at once.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you look at the results image below, you can see that the last ticket I checked was not a winner. Bummer, right? From a design standpoint, what’s wrong here? Well, why do I need two buttons on the screen that both do the same thing?<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2018\/nc-lottery-3.png\" alt=\"NC Lottery App #3\" width=\"293\" height=\"602\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Also, notice that the top button is finger-friendly. If the designer noticed that this button needed to be bigger so it can be easily tapped by a finger, why wasn’t the same approach taken with the original button (which is still displayed)?<\/p>\r\n<p>My real issue here though is that whomever coded this, doesn’t clear the results area of the page when scanning another ticket. So, if I scan a losing ticket, then scan another losing ticket, there’s no visual indicator that I’ve scanned a new ticket. The page doesn’t clear or refresh, NOTHING changes on the results page between scans. Useless, absolutely useless.<\/p>\r\n<p>If the ticket is a winner, confetti falls from the top of the screen and the results panel updates with the prize, so it’s easy to see that the scan works. When scanning two losing tickets in sequence, there’s no way for me to tell whether the app just failed scanning the second ticket. Designers and developers:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Think through all use cases.<\/li>\r\n<li>Watch real users actually use your app<\/li>\r\n<li>Ask questions of people who don’t already know how to use your app<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>The most interesting things I’ve learned from users is how they use tools in different ways than the tool (app) designer expected. That’s one of the most interesting aspects of using Analytics tools to track how users use your app - you can sit in your office or cubicle and ‘see’ the path people take through your app. With that data in hand, make decisions on where to invest your efforts, or how to update your app designs to better accommodate your user’s needs.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"40","created":"2018-12-11 01:40:16","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2018-12-11 01:40:16","modified_by":"0","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2018-12-11 01:40:16","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"1","ordering":"1","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"4677","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

{"id":"523","asset_id":"682","title":"9-Patch Files for Ionic Capacitor Apps","alias":"9-patch-files-for-ionic-capacitor-apps","introtext":"<p>I’ve been working on my first app store app; it’s an app that, I think, is prett1y unique. I’m submitting the app to the Android app store this week and will add the iOS version sometime before the end of the year. The application is an Ionic app and I really enjoyed writing it.<\/p>\r\n<p>As I completed the app, I had one lingering bug that I just couldn’t squash. I sought help on the Ionic Forums, but eventually hired <a href=\"https:\/\/www.joshmorony.com\/\">Josh Morony<\/a> to help me figure it out. I learned Ionic development from Josh’s book and tutorials, and he was very helpful, but he wasn’t able to help me squash that bug. I eventually figured it out with the help of <a href=\"https:\/\/mhartington.io\/\">Mike Hartington<\/a> from the Ionic team figured it out. Thanks Mike!<\/p>\r\n<p>With the bug squashed, it was time to start thinking of putting the finishing touches on the app’s UI, and that meant adding a splash screen to the app. I hired <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fiverr.com\/rupindersingh\">rupindersingh<\/a> on Fiverr to design an icon and splash screen for me but on the Android app the splash screen just didn’t look right. Android uses 9-patch files to create a dynamically expandable splash screen image but I just couldn’t figure out how to make one (the docs for the 9-patch tools in Android Studio are light, very light). I reached out to Josh Morony and asked for more help. He said that he’d been wanting to figure out how to work with splash screens on Ionic Capacitor and offered to figure it out and publish a blog post about it; you can find the resulting blog post <a href=\"https:\/\/www.joshmorony.com\/creating-a-dynamic-universal-splash-screen-for-capacitor-android\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>Well, Josh’s article got me to where I needed to be – the splash screen works perfect on Android\/Capacitor now. However, I really struggled with Josh’s 9-patch instructions – with his help, I was able to figure it out, but it just wasn’t easy. With that in mind, I took Josh’s article and updated it with my learnings and sent it to him so he could update his article with the additional information I learned. In response, he said “Thanks for taking the time to share your experience, I'll review your edits and incorporate them in a new version of the article when I have some time :)”<\/p>\r\n<p>It’s been four months and I haven’t seen an updated to Josh’s article yet, so I decided to go ahead and publish mine. I really appreciate Josh’s help and the article he published clearly helped me get over the hump and got my splash screen working. I just think developers need more information about how to create 9-patch files. With that in mind, here’s my version of the 9-patch article with Credit to Josh for his help.<\/p>\r\n<h1>The 9-Patch File<\/h1>\r\n<p>A 9-Patch file is a special type of image that has an extra 1px border all the way around the original image. Within this 1px border, you set individual pixels either black or transparent to instruct how the image should be stretched by the device at runtime. When the Android OS renders the image, it deletes (or hides, who knows) those black pixels and stretches that image area as needed to properly display the image on the screen.<\/p>\r\n<p>For example, in the following figure you can see how the highlighted areas have black pixels set, indicating that those are the parts of the image that stretch to accommodate the device’s screen resolution. By marking sections on the top and left border with black pixels, we can indicate the sections that we want to be stretched to fit the required screen dimensions (these sections are shown in pink).<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2019\/9-patch_01.png\" width=\"1024\" height=\"479\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>All you need to a create a 9-patch file is an application that can add that 1-pixel border to the image file and let you set, or clear, pixels in that border to create the stretched image you need. I looked around and didn’t find any image editors that supported 9-patch files out of the box, but here are some articles that show how to do it in <a href=\"https:&lt;a href=\" mailto:=\"\" medium=\"\" com=\"\" wdziemia=\"\" 9-patch-photoshop-and-you-3a4736772ad3=\"\">\/\/medium.com\/@wdziemia\/9-patch-photoshop-and-you-3a4736772ad3<\/a>\"&gt;PhotoShop. The good news is that Android Studio can create the files for you automatically (but instructions for how to do so are fairly useless).<\/p>\r\n<p>You can also add black pixels on the right and bottom border, but this does not define the area to be stretched. This defines the area to be “filled”, which is not required in our case for splash screens.<\/p>\r\n<h1>Creating 9-Patch Files<\/h1>\r\n<p>At this point, follow Josh’s instructions for creating the necessary image files and configuring the Android project. Back in Android Studio, right-click on each of the new splash screen files and choose <strong>Create 9-Patch File...<\/strong>. When prompted, save these new files in the same folder as the original splash screen and keep the splash.9.png name Android Studio uses by default.<\/p>\r\n<p>Once you complete the adjustments to the new 9-Patch files (covered in the next section), you can delete the original splash screen files. If you leave them there, you’ll get an error during build, so you do have to delete them, but not now. Android Studio has a nasty quirk that will cause you pain if you delete the original files now. Whenever you make a change to the file using Android Studio’s 9-patch editor, the changes are immediately written to the file and there’s no undo. So, in the next section when you’re making changes, if you mess it up, you’ll have to delete the 9-patch file and recreate it from the original, so that’s why it makes sense to keep the original around for now.<\/p>\r\n<p>The instructions that follow apply to a splash image with a centrally located logo in a field of solid color (like the current Capacitor logo). The process is basically the same for more sophisticated images, but the results may differ based on the complexity of your image.<\/p>\r\n<p>Note: Remember, Android Studio automatically saves everything you do here, with no undo, so be prepared to make a bunch of mistakes and recreate your work repeatedly until you get it right.<\/p>\r\n<p>In Android Studio, double-click on one of the new 9-Patch files, Studio will open an editor like the one shown in the earlier figure.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now, using the following figure as a guide, follow the steps below.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2019\/9-patch_02.png\" alt=\"\" \/><span style=\"font: 7pt 'Times New Roman';\"><\/span><\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>In the editor, enable the <strong>Show patches<\/strong> checkbox so you can more easily see your work.<span style=\"font: 7pt 'Times New Roman';\"><\/span><\/li>\r\n<li>Place your mouse at position 1, then click and drag (holding the mouse button down) into the left side of the image. Once the mouse enters the image, drag it down (staying in the image) past the bottom of the image, then release the mouse button.<\/li>\r\n<li>The editor highlights the width of the image in grey starting where your mouse hit the image all the way down to the bottom. When you release the mouse button, it highlights part of the area in pink with black pixels marked in the left margin. If the top portion of the marked area covers part of the logo – place your mouse over the left side of the image, right where the highlighted area starts, and a handle should appear you can use to reposition the top of the highlighted area so it doesn’t cover the logo.<span style=\"font: 7pt 'Times New Roman';\"><\/span><\/li>\r\n<li>Next, place your mouse at position 2 then click and drag into the image. Once you’re inside, keep the mouse button down and (staying in the image) drag up over the top of the image then release the mouse button. You should now see a pink highlighted area at the top of the image as well (with black pixels in the margin matching the highlighted area).<span style=\"font: 7pt 'Times New Roman';\"><\/span><\/li>\r\n<li>Are you starting to see a pattern yet? Place the mouse at position 3 then click and drag down into the image. Once you’re inside, keep the mouse button down and (staying in the image) drag the mouse left, over the left border of the image then release the mouse button. You should now see a pink highlighted area at the top left of the image as well (with black pixels in the top margin matching the new highlighted area).<span style=\"font: 7pt 'Times New Roman';\"><\/span><\/li>\r\n<li>Finally, Place the mouse at position 4 then click and drag down into the image. Once you’re inside, keep the mouse button down and (staying in the image) drag the mouse right, over the right border of the image then release the mouse button. You should now see a pink highlighted area at the top-right of the image as well (with black pixels in the top margin matching the new highlighted area).<\/li>\r\n<li>That’s it, that’s all you must do. Use the handles to adjust the highlighted areas so the central logo is evenly bracketed by the pink areas. On the right of the editor, Android Studio displays multiple copies of the stretched image so you can quickly see how each change you make affects the different orientations. Studio has some problem with scale for larger images, so you may have to scroll the window to see all the samples.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>In the end, you want some black pixels on the top and left, indicating the stretched areas - there shouldn’t be any black pixels on the right or bottom sides of the image.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you do all this work, and think you got it right, but Android Studio complains with the following error during the build process:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.5in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Courier New';\">Android resource compilation failed<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.5in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Courier New';\">error: too many padding sections on bottom border.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.5in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Courier New';\">D:\\dev\\projects\\time-slicer\\ionic\\android\\app\\src\\main\\res\\drawable-xxhdpi\\splash.9.png: error: file failed to compile.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>Here’s what happened: as you dragged handles around trying to get the image just right, you may have inadvertently left some remnants that Android Studio isn’t rendering properly for you. Switch to an image editing application and open the image, if you see more black pixels than Android Studio shows in the 9-patch editor, either use the image editing application to remove all the errant pixels, or delete the 9-patch file and start over.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"14","created":"2019-11-13 12:39:52","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2019-11-12 17:38:55","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2019-11-13 12:39:52","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"5","ordering":"7","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"4171","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

The list of sample projects is shown in the figure below.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 8px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><span style=\"display: inline-block; overflow: hidden;\">&nbsp;<img src=\"images\/stories\/2019\/time-slicer-01.png\" alt=\"Time Slicer Project List\" width=\"479\" height=\"853\" \/><\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 8px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Swipe left on an item to edit or delete it. Tap the plus sign at the top of the list to add a new project.

When you tap one of the categories, the stopwatch starts tracking time spent on that category as shown in the following figure.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 8px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><span style=\"display: inline-block; overflow: hidden;\">&nbsp;<img src=\"images\/stories\/2019\/time-slicer-04.png\" alt=\"Time Slicer Stopwatch (running)\" width=\"479\" height=\"853\" \/><\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 8px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">When you stop the stopwatch, you can share the results with any local application using the mobile device’s standard sharing process.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 8px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Overall, it’s a pretty simple application. Figuring out how to track multiple timers simultaneously was the biggest challenge, but I eventually came up with a very elegant solution for this. I won’t publish the source code for the app, but I likely will write a post here about how I solved the timer problem.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 8px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">If you think about it, it’s not a very useful app, but it does solve the problem it was designed to solve. I do think that many people will find it useful; I think its most useful for user experience and other types of researchers who watch people work or solve problems and need to track time spent on different types of activities.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 8px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">I’m certain that many users will think this is an app for tracking time (like lawyers and consultants billing their time). It can be used for that, but there are a lot of better solutions out there for that type of problem.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"14","created":"2019-11-27 12:18:02","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2019-11-27 12:22:43","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2019-11-27 12:18:02","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"4","ordering":"6","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"2616","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

I’ve followed the project for years now and I’m convinced that Flutter is the next big thing for client software development. It feels like Flutter solves a lot of the cross-platform development issues mobile developers faced for years (and many, many commercial and open source products tried to solve, but most failed).&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 8px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">What Flutter should solve with their Hummingbird project is also cover cross-platform development for web apps as well - enabling developers to build their native mobile app and web app with mostly the same code base.

The book suggests building a suite of subfolders there to structure your app’s code and I agree. The author even suggests adding an assets folder for, well, assets, and I agree with that as well.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 8px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Expecting that I’m going to be making a lot of Flutter apps in the future (I’ve already started working on my second app store project in Flutter) I decided to streamline the folder creation process with some code. Using the suggested project folder structure from the book, I created a node module called flutter-folders that implements a CLI a developer can use to create the following folder structure inside a Flutter project:<\/span><\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style-type: disc;

Flutter is everything I need for cross-platform mobile development. I’m planning on submitting my second app to the Google Play Store next week and it’s a Flutter app. I’ll write more about it here once it’s published.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 8px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">A while back, I created a Node module that automates creating lib and asset folders in a Flutter project. The project is called Flutter Folders (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/flutter-folders\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/flutter-folders\">https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/flutter-folders<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">) and I made some changes this morning to enhance the module so it also updates the pubspec.yaml file to configure the assets folders the module creates.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 8px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">I created a few static sites in Jekyll, my last book’s site is a Jekyll site plus my randomerrors.dev site is Jekyll too. I recently migrated my last two Apache Cordova book web sites to Jekyll sites as well, so that’s a lot of Jekylling. One of the things that frustrated me about working with Jekyll is that recent updates to the framework\/platform\/generator configures the target system so template files are stored in Gem rather than with the site and that’s caused me some problems. Whenever I need to copy one of the template files into my project (so I can modify it), I have to dig up the instructions for how to locate the template folder, navigate there, then copy the file to my project.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 8px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">To solve this problem for me and other developers, I created a Node module called Jekyll Copy (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/jekyll-copy\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/jekyll-copy\">https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/jekyll-copy<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">). It allows you to list the template folders and easily copy them to your project folder with a couple of quick commands. No need to know where the template files are, the module reads the local config.yml file, locates the template folder and&nbsp; gets to work. I know it saves me time, I hope others find it useful as well.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 8px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">I’ve also started a couple of hardware projects that I hope will eventually become Kickstarter projects. One’s a pure hardware play while the other one has a mobile app component (along with some hardware). The mobile app’s written in Flutter - that’s the one I’m submitting to Google next week and hopefully Apple the following week.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 8px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">I was doing a fair bit of Arduino development - using my favorite platform: the Particle Photon. For that project, I liked the simplicity of the cloud platform, but since this application is local only, I don’t need the cloud service as much. I’ve pivoted and I’m trying to do the same project using the ESP32. I may release the Particle version as a hobbyist project through Kickstarter but the ESP32 one will be the Pro (pre-assembled and turnkey) version. Stay tuned on that one.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 8px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">I think that covers all of my recent development efforts.

Users of the app define as many (or as few) projects as they want for their particular needs and add the categories that make the most sense for the project.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 8px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">I specifically added a tutorial to the app that walks you through the process so you can see that projects and categories are dynamic - they’re whatever you want them to be.

{"id":"531","asset_id":"692","title":"Platform-Specific Links in Ionic","alias":"platform-specific-links-in-ionic","introtext":"<p>When I submitted the Time Slicer app to the Apple App Store, they rejected it. That was not necessarily a bad thing as I really expected them to do so. This was my first App Store submission (I will submit my second one next week) and I had no idea what I was doing, so I expected at least one rejection, possibly more.<\/p>\r\n<p>What surprised me though was Apple’s reason for rejecting me:<\/p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>We noticed that your app or its metadata includes irrelevant third-party platform information.<\/p>\r\n<p>Specifically, your app includes non-iOS device images in the tutorial screens.<\/p>\r\n<p>Referencing third-party platforms in your app or its metadata is not permitted on the App Store unless there is specific interactive functionality.<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<p>Aaah, Yes – the app screen shots in the app’s Intro and About pages. Well that was unexpected (unexpected because I never read Apple’s publishing guidelines), but not a big issue to fix.<\/p>\r\n<p>I started thinking about how I would solve this problem, and my first thought was to use Ionic platform, or specifically Capacitor platform lifecycle hooks. For platforms that have a CLI (like Ionic and Capacitor), hooks are a way to link your code into different parts of the process the CLI manages. I came up with a different approach, one I’m describing in this post, but it turns out that the Ionic CLI has hooks (<a href=\"https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/docs\/cli\/configuration#hooks\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/docs\/cli\/configuration#hooks\">https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/docs\/cli\/configuration#hooks<\/a>) and 14 days ago someone added hooks to the Capacitor CLI (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-cli\/pull\/4417\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-cli\/pull\/4417\">https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-cli\/pull\/4417<\/a>). Pretty cool stuff and something I’m going to have to look into later.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, I decided to implement a solution that used the platform the app was running on to determine which images to load on the About and Intro pages. I’d essentially make two sets of screen shots, one for Android and the other for iOS, and load the right one dynamically at runtime. This isn’t a very clean solution, since it forces the app to hold images for both platforms knowing it would only ever show one on the device. Using hooks to put the right images in the right place for Android and iOS would be the cleaner implementation, I just didn’t go there.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, so I populated the app’s assets folder with the appropriate files. The images were originally called intro-01.png, intro-02.png, etc. but with the Android and iOS versions, I appended the platform name to the front of the file name, so my image files were labeled android-intro-01.png, android-intro-02.png, etc. and ios-intro-01.png, ios-intro-02.png, etc. With the files in place, I then had to update the code.<\/p>\r\n<p>First I updated the TypeScript code for each page (into.page.ts and about.page.ts) with the following:<\/p>\r\n<p>Added an import for the Platform module:<\/p>\r\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>import {, Platform } from '@ionic\/angular';<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Next I updated the constructor to instantiate the platform variable:<\/p>\r\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>constructor(\r\n  public platform: Platform,\r\n) { }<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>Then I added a variable called <span style=\"font-size: 9pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Courier New';\">runningOn<\/span> to the top of the page class:<\/p>\r\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>runningOn: String = 'android';<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>&nbsp;This sets the default platform to Android and will cause the Android screen shots to display in the Electron or other platform versions of the app (If I ever make them)<\/p>\r\n<p>On Init, we need the app to set the platform to iOS if running on iOS, so I added the following code:<\/p>\r\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>ngOnInit() {\r\n    \/\/ If we're on iOS, show iOS images\r\n    if (this.platform.is('ios')) {\r\n      this.runningOn = 'ios';\r\n    }\r\n  }<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>&nbsp;This resets the runningOn variable appropriately on iOS devices.<\/p>\r\n<p>This is what the Intro Page code looks like in its entirety:<\/p>\r\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular\/core';\r\nimport { NavController, Platform } from '@ionic\/angular';\r\nimport { Storage } from '@ionic\/storage';\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-intro',\r\n  templateUrl: '.\/intro.page.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['.\/intro.page.scss'],\r\n})\r\nexport class IntroPage implements OnInit {\r\n  runningOn: String = 'android';\r\n  constructor(\r\n    private navCtrl: NavController,\r\n    public platform: Platform,\r\n    private storage: Storage\r\n  ) { }\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n    \/\/ If we're on iOS, show iOS images\r\n    if (this.platform.is('ios')) {\r\n      this.runningOn = 'ios';\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  goHome() {\r\n    \/\/ if not, set the flag saying we have\r\n    this.storage.set('introShown', true);\r\n    \/\/ then show the intro slider page\r\n    this.navCtrl.navigateRoot('\/');\r\n  }\r\n}<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>On the app pages, I load the images using the <span style=\"font-size: 9pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Courier New';\">ion-img<\/span> component:<\/p>\r\n<pre class=\"language-markup\"><code>&lt;ion-img class=\"screenshot\" src=\"assets\/intro-01.png\"&gt;&lt;\/ion-img&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Now that I have the <span style=\"font-size: 9pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Courier New';\">runningOn<\/span> variable in the app to let it know on which platform it’s running; I can update the link component with the following:<\/p>\r\n<pre class=\"language-markup\"><code>&lt;ion-img class=\"screenshot\" src=\"assets\/{{runningOn}}-intro-01.png\"&gt;&lt;\/ion-img&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>This changes the URL, appending the platform name at runtime and loading the correct image depending on the platform.<\/p>\r\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>ngOnInit() {\r\n  \/\/ If we're on iOS, show iOS images\r\n  if (this.platform.is('ios')) {\r\n    this.runningOn = 'ios';\r\n  }\r\n  if (this.platform.is('electron')) {\r\nnbsp;   this.runningOn = 'electron';\r\n  }\r\ncode&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>&nbsp;The Ionic Platform module does not offer a method to retrieve the platform name (it should), so you must ask it for each platform. So, to add support for Electron-specific images, then the <span style=\"font-size: 9pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Courier New';\">ngOnInit<\/span> code would look like this:<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"14","created":"2020-05-14 11:39:47","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2020-06-06 10:52:22","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2020-05-14 11:39:47","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"7","ordering":"3","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"1520","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

{"id":"534","asset_id":"695","title":"Discarding Data Object Edits in Ionic","alias":"discarding-data-object-edits-in-ionic","introtext":"<p>When I first learned Ionic development a little over three years ago, the default examples for editing a data object didn’t make any accommodation for the user cancelling their edit. All examples showed how to build a details or settings page which included a back button which takes the user back to the previous screen. Any edits they made to the data presented in the page were automatically saved and updated in other parts of the app that displayed the data. For some edits, especially for configuration settings, I always give my app users the ability to cancel changes.<\/p>\r\n<p>The issue in doing that is that Ionic is a very capable Reactive framework, so it’s designed to automatically wire the app UI to its data so any change in one place is automatically reflected elsewhere. This is a great feature, but frustrating when you don’t want it to work this way.<\/p>\r\n<p>When I first encountered this, I poked and prodded at the issue for a long time before turning to Ionic Support for help. They finally helped me understand how to resolve the issue. The solution? When I open a page to edit some data, if I want to be able to discard changes, I must first clone the object then wire the page UI to the cloned object. When the user taps the cancel button, I throw away the clone. When the user taps the Done or Save button, I update the original object from the clone, then close the dialog.<\/p>\r\n<p>It’s a simple and elegant solution, but a solution I had a hard time finding when I needed it.<\/p>\r\n<p>Back with Ionic 3, the recommended solution was to use the Lodash (<a href=\"https:\/\/lodash.com\/\">https:\/\/lodash.com\/<\/a>) clone method to make the clone, and that worked great for a while. Later versions of either Ionic or the Lodash library broke things, so I could no longer use Lodash to solve this particular problem.<\/p>\r\n<p>When this happened, I reached out again to Ionic and they provided me with a little, custom clone object I could use for my Ionic apps. Since I originally had a problem finding a solution for this, I decided I’d publish a complete sample application that demonstrated the solution. I finally got around to completing the sample yesterday and published the project (with a complete explanation of the code) to the Ionic Edit Object Sample <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/ionic-edit-object-sample\">https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/ionic-edit-object-sample<\/a> repository.<\/p>\r\n<p>The app’s main screen looks like the following figure.

I reached out to the manufacturer and purchased the parts I needed to fix it and quickly put it back together just in time for the cousins to visit.<\/p>\r\n<p>This time, it lasted less than an hour; all these years later, I still don’t know who did it, but someone wanted to see what would happen if they held the lid closed and turned on the power, so they did.

It’s now sitting in my office, right at the top of a bookshelf that sits next to the stairs down to the first floor.

I didn’t click the link, but when I opened the browser to the root domain (<a href=\"https:\/\/domain-registration.ga\">https:\/\/domain-registration.ga<\/a>) I saw a generic page prompting visitors to re-register their domain for one year, two years, etc. as shown in the following figure:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2021\/fake-domain-registration.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately this makes it really, really easy for people to give these criminals their money.<\/p>\r\n<p>Notice the fake McAfee, TRUSTe and Norton images, falsely claiming validation from trusted companies.

{"id":"538","asset_id":"702","title":"Starting a New Job Monday","alias":"starting-a-new-job-monday","introtext":"<p>I start a new job on Monday. I've been out of full time work since the end of September, which has been a lot of fun, but its time to get back to work and have steady income and benefits again.<\/p>\r\n<p>During my time off, I did some interesting things. I completed certification as an OutSystems platform Reactive developer. I tried to complete my CSSLP (Certified Secure Software Lifecycle Professional) certification but failed the exam; that was a tough blow, but at least I focused some energy on development security for a while, so that put me in a good place.<\/p>\r\n<p>I did some consulting work for a company, designed and helped build a cloud-based sales automation tool. This gave me an excellent opportunity to learn Firebase Functions and Google Cloud SQL plus I worked on my largest ever Ionic project which really solidified my skills there.<\/p>\r\n","fulltext":"\r\n<p>In all, losing my job was quite painful, but I used the time to enhance my skills while I looked for new opportunities. I didn't sit on my ass and relax.<\/p>\r\n<p>Looking for a job during the Pandemic was hard, but different than I expected. Previous experience and research in the job market made me believe that people didn't get jobs anymore by applying for them online. That turned out not to be the case, I was very active on LinkedIn finding and applying for positions and I got quite a few interviews that way. Knowing someone still pays off more, but I found a nice balance between working with people I know and applying for jobs blindly. As it turns out, I got two offers, one from someone I'd worked for before and another from a company I applied to blindly last year.<\/p>\r\n<p>Companies sure make you work harder nowadays to earn a position. Most companies I dealt with during my job search asked me to perform some sort of task as part of the interviewing procees which ended up consuming a lot of my time without benefit. I laughed inside when a company looking to hire me as a manager for some technical writers asked me to do a writing exercise. I thought for sure that availability of 8 books written by me plus numerous public examples of blog posts, documentation articles and the like would be enough, but they asked me to write something anyway.&nbsp; In another example, when applying for a developer relations position for a company (a job that really interested me), I was really surprised they asked me to do a coding exercise. Again, I thought that my 7 technical books plus numerous blog posts and more than 60 public code repos on GitHub were enough to prove my coding chops, but apparently not. I did learn something about NodeJS development in the process, but I would have preferred that they look at my public body of work rather than make me create something new just for them.<\/p>\r\n<p>What bothered me the most about this whole job search process is Recruiters lack of responsiveness. I often waited weeks to hear back from recruiters on jobs I interviewed for and that was painful.&nbsp; In several cases, I didn't get the job I wanted (for whatever reason) but the recruiter assured me that the company liked me and that I should apply for another position. I'd quickly look around for other interesting open positions and apply for them (letting the recruiter know) only to get no response for weeks or more than a month (even sometimes no response ever again). Don't lie to me, if you don't want to hire me that's OK, you're not going to hurt my feelings. But, don't leave me on the hook for weeks at a time when I could be expending job search energy in other ways.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>How hard is it to reply to an email a few days after an interview series ended and give the candidate an update? Not hard really, but it rarely happened in this recent job search.<\/p>\r\n<p>One of the funniest and potentially saddest issues I came across was for a position I applied for in a big company. The recruiter reached out to me and asked a few questions about my application and I responded in a matter of hours. A week later, nothing - so I sent the recruiter a follow-up email - nothing. Another week goes by and I sent another follow-up email. Crickets. Finally after a few weeks of this with no response from the recruiter I finally got a text message from the recruiter asking if I was interested in the position. Yes, of course I was, I replied, I've been emailing you for weeks now. It turns out, of course, that none of my return messages made it into the recruiter's inbox. Thank goodness for this particular recruiter's efforts, otherwise I wouldn't have a chance to interview for that position (which I didn't get anyway).<\/p>\r\n<p>I have one last story to tell - about the time I talked myself out of a job opportunity while speaking with the VP at the end of a series of interviews. Its the first time I really ever knew exactly when I didn't earn the position I applied for.&nbsp; Perhaps I'll write about that tomorrow.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n  Photo by <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@martenbjork?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Marten Bjork<\/a> on <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/s\/photos\/job?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash<\/a>  \r\n<\/p>","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2021-04-01 12:45:21","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2021-04-02 17:03:59","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2021-04-01 12:45:21","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/2021\\\/marten-bjork-6dW3xyQvcYE-unsplash-870.jpg\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/2021\\\/marten-bjork-6dW3xyQvcYE-unsplash-800.jpg\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"8","ordering":"7","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"1083","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"539","asset_id":"703","title":"Talking Myself Out of a Job","alias":"talking-myself-out-of-a-job","introtext":"<p>As I mentioned in yesterday’s post, I have another hiring story to tell, and here it is. The way I portrayed it in yesterday’s post and in the article title above you may think this is a sad story, that I did something horrible that cost me a job opportunity. That’s not the case; what happened was I very honestly answered a question during an interview and that, well, killed the job opportunity for me, but not in a bad way. Let me explain...<\/p>\r\n","fulltext":"\r\n<h1>The Setup<\/h1>\r\n<p>I applied online for a Principal Program Manager role for a large software company; they have a public service that millions of people use, and they were looking for a PM to shepherd some technical, and likely customer impactful, infrastructure changes they planned for the service. There wouldn’t be a lot of feature development work in this position for a year or more, but the problems we encountered during that first period would be thorny, and for that reason I was very interested in the position.<\/p>\r\n<p>This is the same position I wrote about where I received an email from the Recruiter letting me know he was interested in looking at me for the position, but all of my response emails went into his spam folder. Once I got past all the spam folder issues with the recruiter, I heard back that the hiring manager wanted to talk with me.<\/p>\r\n<p>I had the initial conversation with the hiring manager and I left feeling that it would be a great job to have and looked forward to the next step in the process. The hiring manager expected to select a few candidates to put through the next step in the process and I believed I’d be one of them.<\/p>\r\n<p>A few weeks later, they scheduled my ‘Day Of Interviews’ (ominous music plays) interviews.<\/p>\r\n<h1>The Initial Interviews<\/h1>\r\n<p>The Day Of Interviews started with a follow-up call with the hiring manager. We talked more about the position, and I got a good feel for the team and what the day to day would look like. Still interested in the job.<\/p>\r\n<p>The next two interviews were with existing PMs putting me through the PM wringer. One was a PM manager on a partner team, and the other was with a Senior PM on the team I’d join if I earned the position. Both interviewers asked me scenario-based questions around PM topics and I think I did pretty well in the conversation mostly because I’ve been around for a while, had several PM positions in the past, and think I know what I’m doing. I do, really.<\/p>\r\n<h1>The Flashback<\/h1>\r\n<p>I have to be very careful at this point because the part of the story I’m about to tell will make you think that I don’t want another PM position. That’s not true. I start a new Principal Product Manager position on Monday and I’m very excited about it.<\/p>\r\n<p>Before I lost my job at GitHub, I spent a lot of time thinking about the types of jobs I’d be interested in if, you know, I lost my job at GitHub. Yes, I did know I would lose my job at GitHub; GitHub and I were… incompatible. Well, that’s not entirely true, GitHub should have been an excellent opportunity for me, but it just didn’t work out that way. That’s all I’m gonna say about it.<\/p>\r\n<p>I dug out a pad of paper and pencil, sat in my favorite office chair, and spent an hour or so brainstorming with myself (can you brainstorm with yourself?) about which types of jobs I should pursue.<\/p>\r\n<p>At the top of the list was PM positions. My last few jobs (I’ve had a lot of them) were PM positions and I’m very comfortable and happy being a PM. PMs help bring products and product features to market and I like doing that.<\/p>\r\n<p>Bringing in a close second was Evangelist positions. I’m probably happiest in evangelism roles since it keeps me close to developers and lets me write code, white papers, and technical articles plus present technical topics at conferences and customer meetings. All of those things make me very happy. PMs get to write and present, but don’t do so much code writing (and Engineers typically scoff at PM-generated code).<\/p>\r\n<p>I applied recently for a few evangelism jobs and never got anywhere with them. Honestly, I don’t think I’m cool enough anymore to be an evangelist. When I was younger, I had a goatee (still do but it's VERY grey) and that made me cool enough to be a product evangelist. A Goatee or pony tail were the keys \"way back when\" to successful product evangelism roles. Nowadays I’m an old, bald, grey-haired guy, which isn’t ‘evangelism cool’. I recently started wearing hats more frequently, mostly because I’m bald and I need to protect the top of my head, so perhaps if I got a really cool hat and started wearing that all the time I’d be cool enough again to be an evangelist. Who knows?<\/p>\r\n<p>Next came Software Engineer. Yes, of course, software engineering roles are really, really cool. Lots of hard work. Building cool stuff. People using your stuff. Focused work. But, even though I identify as a software developer and play one on television, it’s been a really long time since my job was writing code. I know a lot of development languages, a lot of server and cloud technologies, and I know how to make award-winning commercial products that work. Hold this thought, I’ll get back to this topic later.<\/p>\r\n<p>Final option? CTO, of course. I built and ran a successful commercial software business that created several award-winning products. IBM even sold one of my products worldwide (you’ve heard of them, right?). I earned a position at Forrester Research as a Principal Analyst where customers paid a lot of money to pick my brain about software development topics. I know the market, I know the technologies, I have the experience. But is anyone going to hire me as a CTO coming directly from a series of PM roles? Probably not. Sigh.<\/p>\r\n<p>A lot of important items appeared on that page; things like: ownership\/control over my destiny, huge salary, stock awards, great benefits, etc.<\/p>\r\n<p>Critical conditions for any role? Must be interesting. Must be intellectually challenging. Must be fun!<\/p>\r\n<p>Many years ago I built and ran several technical teams. When I left the enterprise consulting world and moved to mobile, I left management roles for Individual Contributor (IC) roles. After almost 16 years of this, it's time for me to start moving back into management roles. So, for this job search, I promised myself I’d let every hiring manager know I wanted to be in a position where I could grow into management and\/or mentoring positions again. Not a requirement, only that it be a potential option for any role I seek.<\/p>\r\n<h1>Fast-forward a Few Months to Another Flashback<\/h1>\r\n<p>Alright, so after several months in search of a job with no offers, I was despondent. I uncovered a lot of opportunities (more than I expected), worked really hard to earn the position during the interview series, made it through the Day Of Interviews, only to lose the job with limited or no feedback weeks later. Frustrating.<\/p>\r\n<p>Honestly, I think ageism played a role - that and I didn’t wear any cool hats during interviews, but perhaps that’s a story for another time.<\/p>\r\n<p>It was time for some honest soul searching. One Friday night, over an excellent bottle of wine and charcuterie in our kitchen, I had a really honest conversation with my wife. My wife is amazing; she’s been an amazing partner for more than 20 years and we talk about EVERYTHING. She understands technology and used to work at IBM and other technology companies. I knew I could bare my soul on this topic and together we’d figure out what to do next.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, lots of opportunities, lots of interviews. No jobs. Was it me? Yes, it very well could be, and likely was - no reason to have blinders on. What to do about it though? Was it the missing cool hats? Possibly, but probably not. Did ageism play a role? Who knows? Was I looking for the wrong role? Possibly.<\/p>\r\n<p>Would I rather be an Engineer, yes, absolutely. However, I don’t think anyone’s willing to pay me to be an Engineer right now, or at least not pay me as much as I’m used to earning. I know a lot (an awful lot) about software development and Engineering, but it hasn’t been my ‘job’ for a really long time. I clearly have some insecurities about this and I should get over them.<\/p>\r\n<p>We talked for a long time, and may have opened another bottle of wine; the details at this point are fuzzy. I ultimately decided that I would continue to look for PM roles (I finally got one, woohoo!). I would stop looking for evangelism roles - I’m just not cool enough anymore. I would start looking for Engineering roles or Engineering Manager roles (with reasonable expectations, of course).<\/p>\r\n<p>With my path firmly reset, a few days later was my Day Of Interviews...<\/p>\r\n<h1>The Final Interview<\/h1>\r\n<p>OK, so it's time for my final interview for this job. I was pretty exhausted from the previous interview because the interviewer had a formal, structured series of questions that he expected me to answer and I didn’t feel that it let the real me shine through. He drove me to answer specific scenario questions and really didn’t let me tell stories about my career and past experience like I like to do in an interview.<\/p>\r\n<p>The final interview was with the VP of Product for the group, someone with 50 people or so (PMs and PM Managers) working for him. I really wasn’t sure what to expect from him and I had no way of knowing how much he’d know about me at interview time. Boy was I surprised.<\/p>\r\n<p>We started with some excellent pleasantries, he was very easy to talk to. Next, he mentioned that he reviewed my resume, my blog and my public GitHub account (public repositories) in preparation for this interview.<\/p>\r\n<p>HOLD ON, WAIT A MINUTE!!!<\/p>\r\n<p>You mean to tell me that this Product VP spent the time to really, really get to know me before our interview? Holy Crikey - he actually got past my resume and tried to get to know the real me.<\/p>\r\n<p>Through 6 months of interviews, very few people looked at anything except my resume, and perhaps my LinkedIn profile, to learn about me. In several interviews, the interviewer looked at my resume for the first time while I sat there waiting at the beginning of the interview. Remember, in my previous post I mentioned that several companies asked me to do coding exercises as part of the interview process while completely ignoring my 7 books on software development topics, multiple technical magazine articles, and my 60-some public repositories on GitHub as examples of my coding skills.<\/p>\r\n<p>This guy actually studied my code before interviewing me. He mentioned during the interview that he had some software development topics on his list of interview questions, but dropped them after reviewing my GitHub repos. I think, perhaps, I blushed at this point, I know I had goosebumps.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, on to the main purpose for this article (finally, I know). Here we go...<\/p>\r\n<p>His first interview question was essentially “Having looked at your blog and your public GitHub account, I have to ask you: Why do you even want this job? Wouldn’t you rather have an Engineering position?”<\/p>\r\n<p>Having just spent hours drinking wine and talking with my wife about my job search, I had the answer queued up. I told him that I was an Engineer at heart but my most recent experience was with PM roles and that’s where I felt most comfortable. I mentioned that I usually describe myself during interviews as a software developer with more than 30 years of experience; doing this to highlight to interviewers that I’m a PM candidate with strong technical chops. Yes, of course I’d rather be an Engineer but I just didn’t think I had enough recent experience to justify earning the position.<\/p>\r\n<p>That was the exact moment when I talked myself out of the job.<\/p>\r\n<p>I told him that my insecurities kept me from seeking an Engineering job and he agreed (which was excellent, honest feedback from an interviewer). He said it was time for me to update my resume and that he’d pass my current resume and some feedback on to some Engineering VPs within the company to see what opportunities he could find.<\/p>\r\n<p>A week or so later I got an email from the recruiter letting me know I didn’t get the job, but I already knew that 15 minutes into the last interview.<\/p>\r\n<p>Did I update my resume with an Engineering slant and start looking for Engineering positions? No, I didn’t. A short while after that interview I earned the PM position that I begin on Monday and I’m very excited for it. Did I ever hear back from the VP? No, I didn’t - although I pinged the recruiter several times on the topic.<\/p>\r\n<p>When you learn what I’m doing in this new job, you’ll understand why this new position is so exciting for me. It leverages my experience and skills in a specific mobile development area and puts me in a company that produces a leading product in a product category I studied and worked in for something like 10 of the last 16 years.<\/p>\r\n<p>Will I ever go looking for an Engineering position? Who knows. I have a few years of work to do before I can relax financially. I’ll keep my Engineering skills current (I always do) and perhaps when I can retire, but before I do, I’ll look for an Engineering position to keep me busy until I actually retire.<\/p>\r\n<p>Photo by <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@huntersrace?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Hunters Race<\/a> on <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/s\/photos\/job-interview?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash<\/a><\/p>","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2021-04-02 16:42:21","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2021-04-02 21:17:56","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2021-04-02 16:42:21","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/2021\\\/hunters-race-MYbhN8KaaEc-unsplash-870.jpg\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"Photo of a man in a suit\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/2021\\\/hunters-race-MYbhN8KaaEc-unsplash-800.jpg\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"Photo of a man in a suit\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"10","ordering":"5","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"1031","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

{"id":"541","asset_id":"705","title":"Reviewing the Wrong Book","alias":"reviewing-the-wrong-book","introtext":"<p>I was up on Amazon this morning and I noticed the following review of my latest book (<a href=\"https:\/\/learningpwa.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Learning Progressive Web Apps<\/a>):<\/p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Though the author is clearly passionate about PWAs, the writing is poorly edited and the explanations are incomplete. Examples are repeated and reprinted 2-3 times, as are instructions for running sample code.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Despite being a 200+ page book on PWAs, the author delegates the most crucial definitions and explanations to other resources. Precise information about how the API is structured is completely absent from the book — e.g., the service worker container is never even mentioned. Instead, you get unidiomatic examples and shallow explanations covering a fraction of the API. This book reads more like a series of blog posts written by a hobbyist than a programming text.<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<p>I know it's hard to get your ego out of the way of a bad book review, but in this case, I’m pretty sure the book review isn’t for my book. This isn’t the first time this has happened on Amazon, but in the past, Amazon would let me reply to the reviewer and set the record straight. On today’s Amazon, that option is no longer available.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, looking at the review, the reviewer says the book is poorly edited and explanations are incomplete. That alone tells me this reviewer didn’t read the book since the book went through several thorough edits - there’s no typos, misspellings and all of the content is clear and concise.<\/p>\r\n","fulltext":"\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>As for incomplete explanations - over explanation is actually a problem with some of my books (like this one), I make deliberate effort to make my explanations as complete as possible, that’s my writing style. I always write from the perspective that I'm telling a story to someone who knows nothing about the topic (expeting that a more experienced reader will skip the introductory material).<\/p>\r\n<p>Examples repeated and reprinted 2-3 times? Absolutely not, not this book. Each example appears only once in the book. Since the book's sample apps build on previous examples, there are places where previous code is shown as I build new functionality on it. That's the only way to do that type of learning - build on top of previous learning. Instructions for running sample code is repeated throughout the book once per chapter because I can’t know that the reader is jumping around in the content, so I make the content as complete as possible so that the reader won’t get lost. Authors receive contracts form their publishers for a book of a certain length, in many books authors repeat the instructions for every sample and publish the boilerplate code for every example just to drive up the page count for their book.<\/p>\r\n<p>As for “the author delegates the most crucial definitions and explanations to other resources” that again proves that the reviewer didn’t read my book since there is no place in the book where a reader is referred to another resource for details. I link to reference materials, but everything, literally everything you need to learn how to code PWAs is in the book.<\/p>\r\n<p>I don’t understand what the reviewer means by “Precise information about how the API is structured” - what API? I have absolutely no idea what they mean.<\/p>\r\n<p>They are right though that I didn’t make any mention of the service worker container - the book has a whole chapter on Service Workers and everything you need to know about how to work with them is in there - without any need to mention that there’s a container object that hosts all those capabilities.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyway, apologies for the diatribe here, but I can only hope that someone who reads that incorrect review on Amazon will somehow find this and see that the reviewer apparently didn’t read my book or didn’t understand it very well. Does the book have faults? Absolutely. Is it well represented in the review? Nope.<\/p>","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2021-04-20 11:40:56","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2021-05-20 10:32:50","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2021-04-20 11:40:56","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/common\\\/books-870.jpg\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"Photo by Alfons Morales on Unsplash   \",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/common\\\/books-870.jpg\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"Photo by Alfons Morales on Unsplash   \",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"11","ordering":"4","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"908","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"542","asset_id":"706","title":"JavaScript Microcontrollers","alias":"javascript-microcontrollers","introtext":"<p>For many years now, I’ve worked extensively with a variety of microcontrollers and single-board computers. Since I was a small child, I always had an interest in electronics projects and the modern catalog of these computing devices gives me lots of opportunities to play and build things.<\/p>\r\n<p>In my professional life, for most of the last few years I’ve coded primarily using JavaScript and web technologies. My work on the Apache Cordova project and associated books plus my day job for products in the Apache Cordova and mobile development space kept me mostly in JavaScript code (for hybrid application and JavaScript-driven native application work). Because of this, I’m always on the lookout for interesting JavaScript microcontrollers.<\/p>\r\n","fulltext":"\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h2>Tessel<\/h2>\r\n<p>I did some work many years ago on the Tessel platform <a href=\"https:\/\/tessel.io\/;\">https:\/\/tessel.io\/;<\/a> Tessel, in their own words, is “Tessel 2 is a robust IoT and robotics development platform. Leverage all the libraries of Node.JS to create useful devices in minutes with Tessel.” You code projects in JavaScript and the platform’s node engine executes them. You can even build and deploy web server applications to the device. I built and published several application projects for the Tessel platform: two versions of a weather station (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/tessel_weather_station\">https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/tessel_weather_station<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/tessel_m2x_weather_station\">https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/tessel_m2x_weather_station<\/a>) and a garage door controller (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/tessel_garage_door_controller\">https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/tessel_garage_door_controller<\/a>).<\/p>\r\n<p>Coding for the platform is easy, you write your JavaScript code in your favorite editor, then use the Tessel command-line interface (CLI) to provision the device and deploy your code. You can even configure Wi-Fi network settings on the device using the CLI (instead of hard-coding them in your source code).<\/p>\r\n<p>For hobbyists, Tessel is just an open source prototyping platform, they don’t produce a suite of different devices, instead, they produce a single reference device you can use to prototype your project, expecting that you’ll embed the platform in any commercial device you produce from the prototype. They also offer a small catalog of sensors and add-on modules (like the relay I used for my garage controller project and the weather sensor I used for my weather station projects) you can easily plug into the board.<br \/>I really enjoyed working on the platform and wish I could do more with it, but it’s prototype-only approach kept me away. I didn’t have any interesting hardware projects I wanted to build from scratch, and when I did, I selected the ESP32 platform for reasons I’ll explain some day.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Espruino<\/h2>\r\n<p>Another popular JavaScript hardware platform is Espruino <a href=\"https:\/\/www.espruino.com\/.\">https:\/\/www.espruino.com\/.<\/a> Espruino produces a variety of device formats which gives you a lot of flexibility for different types of projects.<\/p>\r\n<p>Coding for Espruino is easy, you can use their CLI to deploy code to devices just like I described for Tessel above. They also offer a browser-based integrated development environment (IDE) they call the Web IDE. The Web IDE allows you to code your application, then push it directly to devices from the same interface; you simply plug the device in via a USB cable and work iteratively with the device through the browser.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2021\/espruino-web-ide.png\" alt=\"Espruino IDE\" width=\"640\" height=\"375\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>I’ve purchased several Espruino devices over the years, but haven’t done anything with them. I just haven’t found something interesting I want to do with them. I played around many years ago with the Espruino Pico device, it’s a USB stick with a microcontroller in it, but again struggled to find an interesting purpose for it.<\/p>\r\n<p>Of special interest to me is the Espruino Puck.js which is essentially a JavaScript programmed Bluetooth button with LEDs and other stuff like sensors inside. Again, I keep looking for something to do with this platform and the puck is such an interesting and capable device that I’m sure something will come up.<\/p>\r\n<p>The biggest issue I have with the platform, and likely one of the reasons I’ve kept away from it, is that the boards are rather expensive. The small and simple Espruino Wi-Di device is $35US which is more than three times more expensive than the much more capable ESP32 device. I keep hoping the prices will drop on these devices, especially not that there are a whole lot of sub-$10 devices out in the market today, but Espruino devices remain a premium choice.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Moddable<\/h2>\r\n<p>My most recent experimentation with JavaScript devices is on the Moddable platform. I think Moddable has incredible potential, for several reasons I’ll explain later, but I’m really struggling to be productive on the platform.<\/p>\r\n<p>Many years ago I was at a trade show (I can’t remember which one) and met a guy named Peter promoting a platform called Kinoma (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kinoma\">https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kinoma<\/a>) they were pre-release, but their JavaScript devices looked really cool so I ordered a few then waited patiently for them to ship. After they arrived, I never got around to playing with them, but by the time I did, the company had shut down. Sigh.<br \/>I’d check in every so often looking to see what the team was doing and a while back discovered that Peter and friends from Kimoma started a new company called Moddable. Moddable produces several inexpensive hardware devices with built-in displays running on Esprissif devices which I think is very interesting. They are also very open about supporting other platforms as well. As with the other platforms covered in this article, you code applications using JavaScript - the combination of JavaScript as a language coupled with built-in displays makes this a very interesting platform for me.<\/p>\r\n<p>What’s interesting about the Moddable platform is that along with the inexpensive hardware, the team’s real focus seems to be the robust and capable device-side JavaScript API available to applications running on the device. They provide well-written Networking, Bluetooth, File System, Graphics API and more - making it really easy to build capable and compelling apps for compatible devices.<\/p>\r\n<p>What’s always worried me when working with microntroller-driven displays is how to actually get what you want on the screen and properly converting graphics files for display. The well-thought out and consistent Moddable device-side API makes this easy and compatible across a variety of devices and displays.<\/p>\r\n<p>My goal is to build a few projects on their hardware platform, then do some on other devices using the Moddable SDK. There’s some complexity to the Moddable SDK, so I plan to pen a few articles sharing what I learned working with the platform and the tools I put in place to make it easier for me.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Platform Differences<\/h2>\r\n<p>There are major differences between the Tessel and Espruino tooling and Moddable’s approach. This isn’t a complaint, simply an explanation that they’re very different.<\/p>\r\n<p>Tessel and Espruino are hardware platforms, so the only code you have to worry about is the JavaScript code you write for your particular project. The devices run a proprietary (but open source) runtime environment (firmware) that executes whatever JavaScript code you publish to the device.<\/p>\r\n<p>Using these devices, you may have to periodically upgrade the device’s runtime environment, but that’s easily done with the platform tools. Typically, as soon as you get your code running on a device, you leave it alone and don’t worry about firmware updates. If it works, just leave it alone.<\/p>\r\n<p>Since Moddable supports a wide variety of hardware platforms, the Moddable team took a different approach to runtime management. The Moddable SDK must deliver a proprietary (although open source) JavaScript runtime to the device before it can execute on the device. This...complicates the toolchain you need on your development system to develop projects using the SDK. I’m not saying it's bad, it's just more work to install and maintain the toolchain on Moddable.<\/p>\r\n<p>To work with the Moddable SDK, you must first install the Moddable SDK and set the client-side environment variables required by the platform. Next, you must install the device SDKs for each hardware platform you work with. The Moddable devices use the Espressif platform, so for those devices you must install the ESP-IDF SDK. I have a bevvy of M5Stack devices (M5Stack devices are cool too) with displays on them; these devices are Espressif-based as well, so I can use the same SDK setup for those devices as well. If I expand my device catalog, I’ll merely have to install the appropriate SDK for those devices to use it with the Moddable JavaScript SDK.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Windows Issues<\/h2>\r\n<p>My primary development environment is Microsoft Windows (I have several macOS devices, but it’s hard to get around more than 30 years of experience developing with specific keyboard capabilities) and I’ve been working though some Moddable SDK installation issues with the Moddable team and hope to have them resolved soon. Right now, the Moddable SDK won’t deploy modules to Moddable devices on my Windows system. I created a clean Windows Virtual Machine (VM) and confirmed the issue appears there as well, so I know the issue is on their side.<\/p>\r\n<p>Once I get that working, I have more articles to deliver here about the development experience, tooling, and the cool projects I have planned for the platform. Stay tuned.<\/p>","state":"1","catid":"41","created":"2021-05-14 10:44:05","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2021-05-20 10:10:58","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2021-05-14 10:44:05","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/common\\\/iot-870.png\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"6","ordering":"6","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"1588","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"543","asset_id":"707","title":"Displaying Build Information in Ionic Applications","alias":"ionic-displaying-build-information","introtext":"<h2>Introduction<\/h2>\r\n<p>This winter, I worked on a project where I had to build a web-based sales automation tool and, for different reasons, I decided to do the project using Ionic. The project was for desktop browsers, and while Ionic wasn’t the best choice for a desktop app, it's the web framework I know the best, so that’s what I used.<\/p>\r\n<p>Since I knew the audience for the app, I knew I’d have to build in specific features to make the app easy to support for non-technical users. One of the things I wanted to make sure I had was the app version and build date easily accessible in the app. I looked around to see if anyone had an existing solution for this, and I found a lot of people looking for a solution but no solution. I decided to make one.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Manipulating the Project Configuration File<\/h2>\r\n<p>Ionic projects use node-based tooling like most web-based frameworks, so Ionic projects already have an easy to update place to maintain the application’s version number - in the project’s package.json file. Here’s a stripped-down version of the package.json file from a new project I just created:<\/p>\r\n<pre>{<br \/> \"name\": \"ionic-app\",<br \/> \"version\": \"0.0.1\",<br \/> \"author\": \"Ionic Framework\",<br \/> \"homepage\": \"<a href=\"https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/\">https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/<\/a>\",<br \/> \"scripts\": {<br \/> \"ng\": \"ng\",<br \/> \"start\": \"ng serve\",<br \/> \"build\": \"ng build\",<br \/> \"test\": \"ng test\",<br \/> \"lint\": \"ng lint\",<br \/> \"e2e\": \"ng e2e\"<br \/> },<br \/> \"description\": \"An Ionic project\"<br \/>}<\/pre>\r\n<p>Notice the `version` property, setup and ready for use.<\/p>\r\n","fulltext":"\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Now, what I needed next was a simple and automated way to update that value every time I built a new version of the app. Fortunately, the Node Package Manager (npm) already has a feature that increments the value for you:<\/p>\r\n<pre>npm version patch<\/pre>\r\n<p>When you execute that command from the Ionic project folder, it automatically increments the patch version (the final value in the version string):<\/p>\r\n<pre>\"version\": \"0.0.2\",<\/pre>\r\n<p>How cool is that?<\/p>\r\n<p>Available options are `major`, `minor`, and `patch`. Updating the `major` version increments the first value in the package.json file’s `version` property. Updating the `minor` version increments the second value in the package.json file’s `version` property. You’ve already seen what `patch` does.

Here’s the file:<\/p>\r\n<pre>export const buildInfo = {<br \/> buildVersion: \"0.0.5\",<br \/> buildDate: 1620867856174,<br \/> buildDateStr: \"Wed May 12 2021 21:04:16 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)\"<br \/>}<\/pre>\r\n<p>To execute the module every time you do a build, just update the build entry in the project’s package.json file:<\/p>\r\n<pre>\"build\": \"npm version patch &amp;&amp; ionic-build-info &amp;&amp; ng build\",<\/pre>\r\n<h2>Displaying Build Information In the App<\/h2>\r\n<p>Now that I had the build information generated and available in the app, it's time to use it in the app. What I wanted to do was display the app build information (version number and build date) on the app’s login page, but I decided instead to simply display it in the console at startup.<\/p>\r\n<p>To do this, I opened the project’s src\/app\/app.component.ts file and added the following import statement to the Top of the file:<\/p>\r\n<pre>import { buildInfo } from '.\/buildinfo';<\/pre>\r\n<p>This loads the contents of the file into a buildInfo variable I can use in my app like this:<\/p>\r\n<pre>console.log(`Build Number: ${buildInfo.buildVersion}`);<br \/>const buildDate = new Date(buildInfo.buildDate);<br \/>console.log(`Build Date: ${buildDate}`);<\/pre>\r\n<p>And there you have it, a quick and painless way to automatically update Ionic app build information accessible from within the app.<\/p>","state":"1","catid":"42","created":"2021-05-14 21:06:00","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2022-12-04 00:55:55","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2021-05-14 21:30:47","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/common\\\/code-870.png\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"9","ordering":"3","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"1084","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

{"id":"545","asset_id":"710","title":"Moddable, Windows, & Visual Studio Code","alias":"moddable-windows-visual-studio-code","introtext":"<p>I’ve been working a bit lately with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.moddable.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Moddable<\/a> platform; I set up their SDK on my macOS and Windows systems, but for several reasons I prefer to code on Windows unless I have to use macOS. The <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Moddable-OpenSource\/moddable\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Moddable SDK<\/a> is very command-line heavy (for reasons I agree with) and as I started coding Moddable JavaScript projects in Visual Studio Code, I realized that there are some tweaks I can document here that may help other Moddable developers using Visual Studio Code on Windows.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Environment Setup<\/h3>\r\n<p>I’m primarily using Moddable with Espressif devices (specifically the ESP32 devices from Moddable and M5Stack) and the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Moddable-OpenSource\/moddable\/blob\/public\/documentation\/devices\/esp32.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Moddable ESP32 installation instructions<\/a> show how to configure a command-line environment setup with all of the environment variables and PATH entries you need to execute Moddable SDK instructions that invoke the Espressif SDK. <br \/>The idea is that you’ll double-click a shortcut to open a properly-configured terminal window (what Windows calls a Command Prompt) and execute all of the Moddable SDK commands from there.<\/p>\r\n<p>The problem for my environment is that I want to do all of my work inside Visual Studio Code (I’m going to start calling it VSC from here) and VSC has its own terminal built in that I can use instead of switching to an external one.","fulltext":"<\/p>\r\n<p>On Windows, the Moddable SDK uses some tools from Visual Studio, and one of the things that comes along with that is a Start menu shortcut that opens a terminal window and executes some commands to configure the terminal window for the Visual Studio tools. On most systems, that shortcut points to the following file:<\/p>\r\n<pre>\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Community\\VC\\Auxiliary\\Build\\vcvars32.bat\"<\/pre>\r\n<p>The Espressif SDK also creates a shortcut that properly configures a terminal window for the Espressif SDK, it executes the following:<\/p>\r\n<pre>C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe \/k \"\"C:\\Users\\&lt;username&gt;\\.espressif\\idf_cmd_init.bat\" \"C:\\Users\\&lt;username&gt;\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python38-32\\\" \"C:\\Program Files\\Git\\cmd\\\"\"<\/pre>\r\n<p>What Moddable tells you to do is update Espressif shortcut so it instead executes both commands when you click it:<\/p>\r\n<pre>%comspec% \/k \"\"%ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Community\\VC\\Auxiliary\\Build\\vcvars32.bat\" &amp;&amp; pushd %IDF_PATH% &amp;&amp; \"%IDF_TOOLS_PATH%\\idf_cmd_init.bat\" \"%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Programs\\Python\\Python38-32\\\" \"%ProgramFiles%\\Git\\cmd\" &amp;&amp; popd\"<\/pre>\r\n<p>What I did was make a copy of the Espressif SDK shortcut and modified that one so I’d still have a clean Espressif SDK environment if I wanted it later.<\/p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, none of this does me any good in VSC, since VSC can’t access the terminal window directly (it has its own). What I did instead is break those commands out into a command file (an executable text file with a .cmd extension) called <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/johnwargo\/9cd1a6c15e98a2ef8a6adeed927f0a7f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mod-set-env.cmd<\/a> that looks like this:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>ECHO OFF<\/code><br \/><code>REM set UPLOAD_PORT=COM6<\/code><br \/><code>REM Do we have the `VCToolsVersion` environment variable?<\/code><br \/><code>IF \"%VCToolsVersion%\"==\"\" (<\/code><br \/><code> call \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Community\\VC\\Auxiliary\\Build\\vcvars32.bat\"<\/code><br \/><code> pushd %IDF_PATH% <\/code><br \/><code> call %IDF_TOOLS_PATH%\\idf_cmd_init.bat C:\\Python39\\ \"C:\\Program Files\\Git\\cmd\\\"<\/code><br \/><code> popd<\/code><br \/><code>) ELSE (<\/code><br \/><code> echo: <\/code><br \/><code> echo Skipping, environment already configured<\/code><br \/><code> exit \/b 1<\/code><br \/><code>)<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>I originally included this command file in my Moddable project folder, but I quickly realized I didn’t want to have to copy that file around into every project, so I put it in a folder full of other random executables that I happened to have on my PATH environment variable. This allows me to execute this file from anywhere.<\/p>\r\n<p>With the file in place, every time I launch VSC to work on a moddable project, I open the VSC terminal windows and execute mod-set-env.cmd and VSC is all set up to work with the project.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Understanding the Command File<\/h3>\r\n<p>There’s a lot going on in this simple command file, so I thought I’d explain the different parts of it. <br \/>At the start of the file is a commented-out line that looks like this:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>REM set UPLOAD_PORT=COM6<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>What this does is sets an environment variable the Espressif SDK uses to identify the port number for a connected device. Apparently the SDK is pretty good at figuring this out on its own, but if it can’t, you can uncomment this line (remove the REM at the start of the line) then specify the port number for your device and the SDK should find it.<\/p>\r\n<p>I disabled that line since on my system the SDK has no issue finding connected devices.<\/p>\r\n<p>Next, the command file checks to see if a specific environment variable is set:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>IF \"%VCToolsVersion%\"==\"\" (<\/code><br \/> <br \/><code>) ELSE (<\/code><br \/> <br \/><code>)<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>The command file sets the VCToolsVersion environment variable when it executes, so I added this check to keep me from running the command file twice. If the environment variable is missing (empty) then the command file executes all the steps to configure the environment:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>call \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Community\\VC\\Auxiliary\\Build\\vcvars32.bat\"<\/code><br \/><code>pushd %IDF_PATH% <\/code><br \/><code>call %IDF_TOOLS_PATH%\\idf_cmd_init.bat C:\\Python39\\ \"C:\\Program Files\\Git\\cmd\\\"<\/code><br \/><code>popd<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>Which should look familiar since it’s the same code the Moddable folks told you to use in your modified shortcut.<\/p>\r\n<p>Why did I pick the VCToolsVersion environment variable? No reason. I randomly picked something in the environment that I knew only existed after I <br \/>configured a terminal window for the Visual Studio development environment. I just needed some way to know I’d already executed the command file and this environment variable check worked the first time.<\/p>\r\n<p>If the environment variable is already set, then the command file warns you and exits:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>echo: <\/code><br \/><code>echo Skipping, environment already configured<\/code><br \/><code>exit \/b 1<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>The echo: by itself enters a blank line in the terminal window.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Deploying to Devices<\/h3>\r\n<p>Now, when it comes to deploying JavaScript code to devices, the Moddable SDK has specific commands you must use depending on whether you’re deploying a Host or Module. Since the two commands are very similar (and have the same command parameters), I decided to create command files for each. Here’s the code I used to deploy the host model; I put in a file called deploy-host.cmd in my Moddable project folder:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>cd host<\/code><br \/><code>mcconfig -d -m -p esp32\/moddable_two<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>The code assumes the host project is in a folder called host (it is, and I’m guessing will normally be by convention).<\/p>\r\n<p>And here’s the code I used to deploy a module called main; I put in a file called deploy-mod.cmd in my Moddable project folder:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>cd main<\/code><br \/><code>mcrun -d -m -p esp32\/moddable_two<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>This isn’t a perfect approach, but it dramatically reduces the amount of typing I must do to deploy hosts and modules in a Moddable project. In the VSC terminal window, all I have to do is type de and hit the Tab key and Windows Auto Complete will prompt me to select the file to execute. In four (host) or five (module) keystrokes I can complete my deployment tasks - a lot less typing than typing the Moddable SDK commands.<\/p>\r\n<p>In my next article, I’ll illustrate a better and easier way to manage Moddable project deployments (on Linux, macOS, and Windows).<\/p>","state":"1","catid":"41","created":"2021-05-20 10:15:17","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2021-05-20 10:20:46","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2021-05-20 10:15:17","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/common\\\/iot-870.png\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"6","ordering":"5","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"1677","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"546","asset_id":"711","title":"Simplifying Moddable Deployments","alias":"simplifying-moddable-deployments","introtext":"<p>As I mentioned in my previous post, the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Moddable-OpenSource\/moddable\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Moddable SDK<\/a> is a command-line driven SDK. It really has to be that way because it's an SDK that works with a variety of devices and each device platform has its own SDK which is usually also command-line driven.<\/p>\r\n<p>Each supported platform has its own environment setup as well. For example, the Espressif platform uses Python and other client side tools and there are special PATH settings needed on the system when working with that platform. Since many developers may switch between hardware platforms on different projects, there’s commands developers must configure and use to switch between the different hardware SDKs.<\/p>\r\n<p>As I worked with the Moddable SDK, I realized that depending on your project’s configuration (host and module folders) and the selected hardware platform, you’re using the exact same Moddable commands but with different command-line options. I realized that there was a way to simplify the commands and eliminate a lot of the repetitive typing you had to do.<\/p>\r\n<p>Let me give you some examples…<\/p>\r\n","fulltext":"\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>When you’re deploying a host module on a device using the Moddable SDK, you’ll use the following commands:<\/p>\r\n<pre>cd host<br \/>mcconfig -d -m -p esp32\/moddable_two<\/pre>\r\n<p>The first command switches the terminal window to the folder hosting the files (in this example it is the `host` folder), and the second command invokes the Moddable SDK’s `mcconfig` command to build and deploy the Moddable core application and host module to the selected device.<\/p>\r\n<p>As I’m testing the host module on a specific device, the commands change little and every time I start my development environment, I have to type the same commands the first time I use them. I can use the command stack feature of my terminal program to repeat the commands later, but when I first open the terminal window, I’m typing those commands every time.<\/p>\r\n<p>If I’m building my project for multiple devices, the commands change a little. Say for example I want to install the host on a M5Stack Fire device, the commands look like this:<\/p>\r\n<pre>cd host<br \/>mcconfig -d -m -p esp32\/m5stack_fire<\/pre>\r\n<p>All that changes is the parameter passed in the platform option (`-p`).<\/p>\r\n<p>When I want to deploy the HelloWorld module to a device already running the host module, the commands change just a little:<\/p>\r\n<pre>cd helloworld<br \/>mcrun -d -m -p esp32\/moddable_two<\/pre>\r\n<p>I have to change to a different folder and the `mcconfig` becomes `mcrun`. And, of course, if deploying the same module to the M5Stack Fire device, the command changes to:<\/p>\r\n<pre>cd helloworld<br \/>mcrun -d -m -p esp32\/m5stack_fire<\/pre>\r\n<h3>Moddable Project Options<\/h3>\r\n<p>A Moddable project could have all of its JavaScript stuff in the host module, but then deploying the host is a very time consuming process because of all the work the SDK has to do to build the core application for the target device plus deploy the JavaScript code as well.<\/p>\r\n<p>Most Moddable projects consist of a host module plus one or more additional JavaScript modules. Developers deploy the host module less frequently (since that takes so long) and do most of their work in JavaScript modules which deploy pretty quickly.<\/p>\r\n<p>This means that a Moddable project typically has a host folder (the folder holding the host module) and additional folders for each of the JavaScript modules used by the project.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Recognizing The Patterns<\/h3>\r\n<p>It didn’t take me very long to recognize the patterns in this process and realize that I could simplify this dramatically while still giving Moddable developers the flexibility they need to support complex Moddable projects deploying to multiple target devices.<\/p>\r\n<p>Here’s what I learned:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A Moddable project can have multiple folders (one for each module).<\/li>\r\n<li>A Moddable project can have only one host module.<\/li>\r\n<li>A Moddable project can have zero or more, I’m not quite sure how to say this, non-host modules<\/li>\r\n<li>Developers only use the Moddable `mcconfig` command for deploying host modules.<\/li>\r\n<li>Developers deploy most modules using the Moddable `mcrun` command.<\/li>\r\n<li>The only command-line options for mcconfig and mcrun that really changes during development is the platform parameter (specifying which hardware device family to which you’re deploying).<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>So I started thinking, what if I abstracted away the complexities of the project into a set of simple commands a developer could use to deploy Moddable modules flexibly without having to remember which Moddable SDK commands to use and which command-line parameters to use?<\/p>\r\n<p>To accommodate that I’d need some sort of project-specific configuration file that described the different folders in the project (which folders held JavaScript modules and which one was the host module for example).<\/p>\r\n<p>I’d also need a configuration file (or a section of a configuration file) to describe the different hardware platforms I’m using for the project.<\/p>\r\n<p>With those three components, I’d have a simplified way to manage my Moddable projects and deployment to a variety of devices.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Introducing Moddable Helper<\/h3>\r\n<p>Based on the requirements listed at the end of the previous section, I created a node package called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/moddable-helper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Moddable Helper<\/a>. When you install the module on your Moddable development system (it works on Linux, macOS, and Windows), it adds a mddbl command you can use to streamline your command typing when working with Moddable projects. mddbl is ‘moddable’ without any vowels; I did that in case the Moddable team someday releases a `moddable` package via <a href=\"https:\/\/npmjs.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">npm<\/a> (Node Package Manager); I didn’t want there to be a conflict with ‘official’ software.<\/p>\r\n<p>At the core of mddbl capabilities is a simple configuration file you add to your Moddable project folder containing settings about your project. The file is called, wait for it, `mddbl.json` and when you first create it, it looks like this:<\/p>\r\n<pre>{<br \/>\"debug\": false,<br \/>\"modules\": [],<br \/>\"targets\": [],<br \/>}<\/pre>\r\n<p>The `debug` option controls how much information the module writes to the terminal window as it executes. The `modules` array defines an array of `module` objects that describe the different source code folders in your project. The `targets` array defines an array of `target` objects that describe the different hardware targets (hardware devices) to which you deploy the project’s modules.<\/p>\r\n<p>A complete configuration file will look something like this:<\/p>\r\n<pre>{<br \/> \"debug\": true,<br \/> \"modules\": [<br \/> {<br \/> \"name\": \"host\",<br \/> \"description\": \"The project's host module\",<br \/> \"isHost\": true,<br \/> \"debugFlag\": true,<br \/> \"makeFlag\": true,<br \/> \"folderPath\": \"host\"<br \/> },<br \/> {<br \/> \"name\": \"hw\",<br \/> \"description\": \"Text-only version of the project\",<br \/> \"isHost\": false,<br \/> \"debugFlag\": true,<br \/> \"makeFlag\": true,<br \/> \"folderPath\": \"helloworld\"<br \/> },<br \/> {<br \/> \"name\": \"hwg\",<br \/> \"description\": \"Hello World Graphical version\",<br \/> \"isHost\": false,<br \/> \"debugFlag\": true,<br \/> \"makeFlag\": true,<br \/> \"folderPath\": \"helloworld-gui\"<br \/> }<br \/> ],<br \/> \"targets\": [<br \/> {<br \/> \"name\": \"mdbl2\",<br \/> \"description\": \"Moddable Two\",<br \/> \"platform\": \"esp32\/moddable_two\",<br \/> \"formatFlag\": false,<br \/> \"formatStr\": \"\",<br \/> \"rotationFlag\": false,<br \/> \"rotationValue\": 0,<br \/> \"wipeCommand\": \"python %IDF_PATH%\\\\components\\\\esptool_py\\\\esptool\\\\esptool.py erase_flash\"<br \/> },<br \/> {<br \/> \"name\": \"m5fire\",<br \/> \"description\": \"M5Stack Fire device\",<br \/> \"platform\": \"esp32\/m5stack_fire\",<br \/> \"formatFlag\": true,<br \/> \"formatStr\": \"gray16\",<br \/> \"rotationFlag\": false,<br \/> \"rotationValue\": 0,<br \/> \"wipeCommand\": \"python %IDF_PATH%\\\\components\\\\esptool_py\\\\esptool\\\\esptool.py erase_flash\"<br \/> }<br \/> ]<br \/>}<\/pre>\r\n<p>This is a configuration file for the Chapter 1 Hello World project in the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Moddable-OpenSource\/iot-product-dev-book\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IoT Development for ESP32 and ESP8266 with JavaScript book repository<\/a> and supports deployment to Moddable Two and M5Stack Fire devices.<\/p>\r\n<p>The project’s readme file provides all the information you need to configure and use the package, so I’m not going to duplicate any of that information here.

{"id":"547","asset_id":"712","title":"Word Clock Time Issues","alias":"word-clock-time-issues","introtext":"<p>I’m a big fan of Andy Doro’s Word Clock (<a href=\"https:\/\/andydoro.com\/wordclockdesktop\/\">https:\/\/andydoro.com\/wordclockdesktop\/<\/a>) project. As soon as I saw the project highlighted in Make Magazine, I immediately ordered the parts and assembled the desktop version of the project. The clock’s been running in our guest bathroom for more than a year now and I recently noticed that the clock wasn’t keeping time very well. It was about 20 minutes fast.<\/p>\r\n<p>Well, I grabbed the source code and looked for an easy way to fix this. The original project is based on the Adafruit Trinket device which doesn’t have a Wi-Fi connection, so it can’t get it's time through Network Time Protocol (NTP). Instead, the project has the following code which tries to initialize the realtime clock (RTC) and, if it can’t (because there’s no time stored in it), it sets the clock to the compile date\/time for the currently running sketch.<\/p>\r\n<pre>RTC.begin(); \/\/ begin clock<br \/>if (! RTC.isrunning()) {<br \/> Serial.println(\"RTC is NOT running!\");<br \/> \/\/ following line sets the RTC to the date &amp; time this <br \/> \/\/ sketch was compiled<br \/> RTC.adjust(DateTime(__DATE__, __TIME__));<br \/> \/\/ DST? If we're in it, let's subtract an hour from the RTC <br \/> \/\/ time to keep our DST calculation correct. This gives us<br \/> \/\/ Standard Time which our DST check will add an hour back to <br \/> \/\/ if we're in DST.<br \/> DateTime standardTime = RTC.now();<br \/> \/\/ check whether we're in DST right now. If we are, subtract an hour.<br \/> if (dst_rtc.checkDST(standardTime) == true) { <br \/> standardTime = standardTime.unixtime() - 3600;<br \/> }<br \/> RTC.adjust(standardTime);<br \/>}<\/pre>\r\n<p>This is a great solution for initially setting the clock, since the first time you run the sketch it automatically sets the clock with the current time. Unfortunately, this code doesn’t work for my situation.<\/p>\r\n","fulltext":"\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>So, I came up with two potential solutions for this problem. I implemented the first one and it worked great for me. The second one sounded great on paper, but it wouldn’t work, I’ll describe it later. So, the only solution I have is to change the sketch’s code so it lets me reset the clock at will.<\/p>\r\n<p>The first thing I did was add a new define to the sketch:<\/p>\r\n<pre>\/* <br \/> * Over time, the RTC may lose accuracy. Since the Trinket<br \/> * doesn't have a Wi-Fi connection, it can't reset its own clock<br \/> * periodically. When this happens, uncomment the following line <br \/> * and deploy to the trinket. It will reset the RTC to the compile<br \/> * date and time, giving the clock a more accurate time. Once that's<br \/> * done, comment out the line again, build, and deploy the sketch to <br \/> * the trinket to reset the sketch to its original behavior. <br \/> * <br \/> * But, thinking of it, the sketch no longer needs the original<br \/> * code in this scenario since we've forced a time on the device,<br \/> * that code will never run again.<br \/>*\/<br \/>\/\/#define RESETCLOCK<\/pre>\r\n<p>It's commented out right now because I only want it uncommented (applied) when I want to reset the clock.<\/p>\r\n<p>Next, I took the code that sets the RTC to the compiled sketch date\/time, and moved it into a separate function:<\/p>\r\n<pre>void setTime() {<br \/> Serial.println(\"Resetting RTC\");<br \/> \/\/ following line sets the RTC to the date &amp; time this sketch was compiled<br \/> RTC.adjust(DateTime(__DATE__, __TIME__));<br \/> \/\/ DST? If we're in it, let's subtract an hour from the RTC time to keep our DST calculation correct. This gives us<br \/> \/\/ Standard Time which our DST check will add an hour back to if we're in DST.<br \/> DateTime standardTime = RTC.now();<br \/> if (dst_rtc.checkDST(standardTime) == true) { \/\/ check whether we're in DST right now. If we are, subtract an hour.<br \/> standardTime = standardTime.unixtime() - 3600;<br \/> }<br \/> RTC.adjust(standardTime);<br \/>}<\/pre>\r\n<p>Finally, I removed this code from the setup() function:<\/p>\r\n<pre>if (! RTC.isrunning()) {<br \/> Serial.println(\"RTC is NOT running!\");<br \/> \/\/ following line sets the RTC to the date &amp; time this <br \/> \/\/ sketch was compiled<br \/> RTC.adjust(DateTime(__DATE__, __TIME__));<br \/> \/\/ DST? If we're in it, let's subtract an hour from the <br \/> \/\/ RTC time to keep our DST calculation correct. This gives us<br \/> \/\/ Standard Time which our DST check will add an hour back to <br \/> \/\/ if we're in DST.<br \/> DateTime standardTime = RTC.now();<br \/> \/\/ check whether we're in DST right now. If we are, <br \/> \/\/ subtract an hour.<br \/> if (dst_rtc.checkDST(standardTime) == true) { <br \/> standardTime = standardTime.unixtime() - 3600;<br \/> }<br \/> RTC.adjust(standardTime);<br \/>}<\/pre>\r\n<p>And replaced it with this code:<\/p>\r\n<pre>#ifdef RESETCLOCK<br \/> setTime();<br \/>#else<br \/> if ( !RTC.isrunning()) {<br \/> Serial.println(\"RTC is NOT running!\");<br \/> setTime();<br \/> }<br \/>#endif<\/pre>\r\n<p>With that in place, I uncommented the define line:<\/p>\r\n<pre>#define RESETCLOCK<\/pre>\r\n<p>Then I compiled and deployed the code to the device. When that finished, my clock’s time was reset to the current time (win!). Next, I commented out the define line:<\/p>\r\n<pre>\/\/#define RESETCLOCK<\/pre>\r\n<p>Then compiled and deployed the code a second time (with the define commented out) and the code’s back to its default behavior.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now this isn’t a perfect solution, but its the best one I could come up with. I submitted this change as a PR to the original repo, but I’m not sure if Andy is accepting contributions.<\/p>\r\n<p>I thought perhaps I could pull the battery and let the RTC memory clear, but as soon as I put the battery back in and power it up, the clock will set to the compile date\/time for the sketch. The only way to make this work is to wipe the Trinket device, pull the battery, then compile and deploy the latest version of the sketch to the device. Since the clock is already assembled, and I’d have to take apart the case to do this, I decided to abandon that approach. That just seems like too much work to me.<\/p>\r\n<p>I could deploy a new version of the sketch to the device, then pull the battery and put it back in again. That would work and the time would only be off by however long it took to pull the battery, put it back in, and power-on the device. Still more work than I want to do considering I’d have to disassemble the enclosure to get at the battery.<\/p>\r\n<p>I have the hardware to build a 12-inch version of the Word Clock; once I get that one built, I’ll publish the details somewhere.<\/p>","state":"1","catid":"41","created":"2021-07-14 23:11:42","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2021-07-14 23:17:05","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2021-07-14 23:13:32","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/common\\\/iot-870.png\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/common\\\/iot-870.png\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"6","ordering":"3","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"1207","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"548","asset_id":"713","title":"Using the Arduino NTPClient Library","alias":"using-the-arduino-ntpclient-library","introtext":"<p>As I mentioned in my previous post, I have a version of Andy Doro’s Word Clock running in my house. I had some issues with the real-time clock (RTC) keeping time correctly, so I decided to rebuild the clock using a Wi-Fi enabled device and the Network Time Protocol (NTP) to keep my clock’s local time synchronized with reality. I’ll write more about that project once I’ve completed it.<\/p>\r\n<p>As I started working on my updated project, I discovered that the Arduino team maintains (well, used to maintain) an NTP Client library called NTPClient (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/arduino-libraries\/NTPClient\">https:\/\/github.com\/arduino-libraries\/NTPClient<\/a>) that would work for my project. The library is pretty easy to use, however it’s woefully under-documented. There’s a very simple readme in the project repository with an overly simple sample sketch and a vague reference to only one of the functions exported by the library.<\/p>\r\n","fulltext":"\r\n<p>Sadly, there are a couple of pull requests (PR) in the repo for documentation changes, but those aren’t getting any love from the team. I thought about proposing some updates to the docs in order to clearly document how the library works, but realized they’d likely not get published. However, I may go back and submit them later.<\/p>\r\n<p>As I tried to learn what the library did, I studied the source code and I now have a better understanding of the inner workings of the library. The purpose of this post is to share some of what I learned.<\/p>\r\n<p>Note: The library expects the device running the sketch (and using the library) to have a valid network connection (typically over Wi-Fi). You can only retrieve the time from a network time server (using NTP) if you can connect to the server over the network. So any sample code you see using the library will connect to Wi-Fi before doing anything else related to the NCPClient library.<\/p>\r\n<p>To use the library in your sketch, you must add two libraries:<\/p>\r\n<pre>#include &lt;NTPClient.h&gt;<br \/>#include &lt;WiFiUdp.h&gt;<\/pre>\r\n<p>Then, you must initialize two variables:<\/p>\r\n<pre>WiFiUDP ntpUDP;<br \/>NTPClient timeClient(ntpUDP);<\/pre>\r\n<p>The NTPClient object supports several initialization options (multiple constructors). The default one shown in the example code uses default values for several configuration options. No matter which approach you use, you must provide a Wi-Fi UDP object to the constructor as shown in the example.<\/p>\r\n<p>UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol which is a communications protocol that enables network devices to exchange messages. Rather than designing its own communication protocols between the client and server, NTPClient just uses an existing standard. You don’t have to do anything with UDP except to create the ntpUDP object as shown in the example and pass it to the NTPClient constructor.<\/p>\r\n<p>The default constructor also configures the client to use the default NTP server pool (described below) and sets an update interval of 1 minute (more on that later as well).<\/p>\r\n<p>If you look at the sample application in the NTPClient repository’s readme file, you’ll also see this code in the sample:<\/p>\r\n<pre>\/\/ You can specify the time server pool and the offset, (in seconds)<br \/>\/\/ additionally you can specify the update interval (in milliseconds).<br \/>\/\/ NTPClient timeClient(ntpUDP, \"europe.pool.ntp.org\", 3600, 60000);<\/pre>\r\n<p>This highlights another supported constructor for the NTP client. In this case, it shows how you can specify a different time server pool, a time offset, and an update interval. Unfortunately, the text doesn’t explain what any of this means, so let me see if I can fill in the blanks:<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Time Server Pool:<\/strong> To make it easier for applications to retrieve the current time using NTP, the community created a ‘big virtual cluster of timeservers’ online. Rather than having to know the specific address\/name for a time server, you can point your client application to a pool of servers and through Internet Magic get connected to any of the servers in the default pool. You can also specify a specific pool like they do in the example depending on your location (for example specifying the pool for Europe). You can read more about Time Server pools at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ntppool.org\/en\/.\">https:\/\/www.ntppool.org\/en\/.<\/a> Unless you have a specific need to specify a pool, I’d just leave things at their default, but I’m not an expert on this topic.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Time Offset:<\/strong> Depending on the application and the time zone you’re in, you may want to set a time offset as well. The time offset specifies the number of seconds by which to adjust the retrieved time. The 3,600 seconds shown in the example is one hour (60 seconds times 60 equals an hour) telling the NTPClient to add an hour to every retrieved time value. The reason this option exists is to enable you to adjust the time for your current time zone. For example, I’m in US Eastern Time (GMT-4) which means I’m 4 hours behind Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and the time offset for my location would be -14,400 (-4 * 60 * 60).<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Update Interval:<\/strong> This parameter seems to indicate that you can specify how frequently the NTPClient updates its time over the network, but that’s not the case. The NTPClient doesn’t automatically update the time from the network. What this parameter does is control how frequently the NTPClient can update the time, and this is where it gets a little weird (and why I wrote this article); I’ll explain this more throughout the remainder of the article.<\/p>\r\n<p>In your sketch’s `setup` function, you’ll initialize the NTPClient using:<\/p>\r\n<pre>timeClient.begin();<\/pre>\r\n<p>Then, in your sketch’s loop function or any other place in your sketch, you’ll update the time from the network using:<\/p>\r\n<pre>timeClient.update();<\/pre>\r\n<p>Then, with the time updated, you can retrieve it using `timeClient.getFormattedTime()` or `timeClient.getEpochTime()`. At this point, you’ll update something in your sketch or do something interesting with the hardware, perhaps even update the time value stored in a realtime-clock (RTC).<\/p>\r\n<p>This is where the update interval comes into play; I’m going to refer to it as UpdateInterval going forward. When you executed the update, you probably expected that the client would connect to the network and do its stuff right away. That’s not what happens. It only updates the time over the network if it has been at least UpdateInterval milliseconds since the last update. By setting UpdateInterval (it defaults to 1 minute) you set guardrails for how frequently the library will update the time when the sketch specifically asks it to.<\/p>\r\n<p>Alright, so that last paragraph probably made you want to ask at least two questions: “How do I force an update so I can get the time whenever I want it?” and “What time will I get if I ask for it before the UpdateInterval completes?”<\/p>\r\n<p>Sadly, I have the answers to those questions only because I studied the source code, not because this is documented anywhere. Sigh.<\/p>\r\n<p>Alright, to the first question: How do I force an update so I can get the time whenever I want it? To force an update (ignoring UpdateInterval) you simply call:<\/p>\r\n<pre>timeClient.forceUpdate();<\/pre>\r\n<p>Internally this is the method that update() calls once it checks to see if UpdateInterval milliseconds has passed since the previous update. Easy, right?<\/p>\r\n<p>To the second question: What time will I get if I ask for it before the UpdateInterval completes? Aaah, excellent question - that’s the question that got me looking at the library source code to begin with.<\/p>\r\n<p>When your sketch calls timeClient.update() before UpdateInterval milliseconds has passed, the library returns the previous time value adjusted by the number of milliseconds that passed since the library last updated the time.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, if that’s the case, what’s the difference?<\/p>\r\n<p>I’m not really sure, but I doubt it's much. The Arduino device running the sketch probably has a good reckoning of how much time passed (in clock ticks) since the last time the library checked, however it is just an approximation. If you have unlimited network capacity, you can probably check the network time as frequently as you want (although I saw an issue in the NTPClient repository mentioning that the default 60 second interval violates the NTP Pool Server terms of service (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/arduino-libraries\/NTPClient\/issues\/123\">https:\/\/github.com\/arduino-libraries\/NTPClient\/issues\/123<\/a>)). For my particular application, I’m going to update an RTC using NTP once a day (immediately after midnight). I can’t imagine I’d need any more accuracy than that.<\/p>","state":"1","catid":"41","created":"2021-07-18 20:08:31","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2021-07-19 00:31:27","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2021-07-18 20:08:31","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/common\\\/iot-870.png\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/common\\\/iot-870.png\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"7","ordering":"2","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"2133","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

I also learned that even though Adafruit published a specification for the Feather platform, the Espressif-based Feather boards have a slightly different footprint which made accurately updating the enclosure a challenge.<\/p>\r\n<p>I completed the updated project assembly last night and published the forked repository this morning on <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/world-clock-neomatrix-wifi-desktop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GitHub<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/world-clock-neomatrix-wifi-desktop.\">.<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p>With that work done, I’ve started working on a wall mounted version of the clock. I have the hardware and software all working, now I have to just start assembling the clock. I’ll publish the results as soon as I’m done.<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"41","created":"2021-08-10 13:57:11","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2021-08-10 13:59:09","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2021-08-10 13:57:11","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"4","ordering":"1","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"972","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"551","asset_id":"716","title":"Looking at the Blues Wireless Platform","alias":"looking-at-the-blues-wireless-platform","introtext":"<p>I love working with microcontrollers; I got started early with the Arduino and Particle Platforms as well as Raspberry Pi (yes, I know, the Pi is not a microcontroller) and many others. I built a few projects on the Particle platform, but I never really got into the Internet of Things (IoT) space. Me hacking around with microcontrollers and single-board computers isn’t necessarily the IoT space.<\/p>\r\n<p>I recently learned about Ray Ozzie’s latest project: Blues Wireless (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.geekwire.com\/2021\/ray-ozzies-telecom-startup-blues-wireless-raises-22m-bill-gates-others\/\">https:\/\/www.geekwire.com\/2021\/ray-ozzies-telecom-startup-blues-wireless-raises-22m-bill-gates-others\/<\/a>) and quickly ordered some hardware and got to work learning how to use it. IoT platforms are usually either a software only solution (running in the cloud) or a combined hardware and software solution. Blues Wireless is the latter. The purpose of this article is to give you my take on the platform, and I’ll likely publish additional articles here or elsewhere showing you how to use it for different types of projects.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Notecard and Notecarrier<\/h2>\r\n<p>Blues’ primary hardware product is the Notecard, a tiny wireless device with a processor, some sensors, and an interface that allows other hardware devices to use it to send and receive data to and from the cloud.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2021\/blues-wireless-notecard.png\" alt=\"Blues Wireless Notecard\" width=\"300\" height=\"316\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Note:&nbsp; Image ‘borrowed’ from the Blues Wireless web site at <a href=\"https:\/\/blues.io\">https:\/\/blues.io<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n","fulltext":"\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>According to the data sheet, Notecard (<a href=\"https:\/\/dev.blues.io\/hardware\/notecard-datasheet\/note-wbex-500\/\">https:\/\/dev.blues.io\/hardware\/notecard-datasheet\/note-wbex-500\/<\/a>) is:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A drop-in embeddable data storage and transport module for cellular IoT products, pumping JSON-formatted or binary data (\"Notes\") bi-directionally between device and cloud:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>JSON from\/to MCU application using I2C, Serial, or USB.<\/li>\r\n<li>JSON to\/from your cloud app using HTTPS.<\/li>\r\n<li>JSON is auto-tagged with date\/time, tower, and GPS locations.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li>A removable and field-upgradable 30mm x 35mm system-on-a-module (SOM).<\/li>\r\n<li>A cellular device without the monthly fees.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>The product page also says:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>500MB and 10 years of cellular connectivity included<\/li>\r\n<li>Global cellular over LTE-M, NB-IoT, or Cat-1<\/li>\r\n<li>Secure “off the internet” communications from device-to-cloud<\/li>\r\n<li>Low-power hardware (~8µA when idle), power-conscious firmware<\/li>\r\n<li>Embed with onboard M.2 Key E connector or via a companion board<\/li>\r\n<li>Unmatched developer experience and JSON-based API<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>As you can see from the specs, Blues thought very carefully about what they built and fit into this small card everything you need for many IoT applications.<\/p>\r\n<p>The game changing aspect of this is that the Notecard includes 500MB of data transfer and 10 years of cellular connectivity. There’s no monthly fees for cellular data, you spend between $49US and $69US for the Notecard and get cellular data coverage for the device for 10 years. I don’t know what happens if you try to use more than 500MB over those 10 years, but as long as you’re smart and careful about how you use the provided data plan you should be OK.<\/p>\r\n<p>For some applications, all you need is the Notecard. If, for example, all you wanted was an asset tracker, you can build one using the accelerometer and GPS sensors along with the wireless radio. All you would have to do is power it up, set the device’s configuration via the command-line tools, and you’re all set - no coding required.<\/p>\r\n<p>Let me explain…<\/p>\r\n<p>The Notecard has a processor, some memory, some sensors, and a wireless radio with loads of data transfer capacity. It is essentially a cellular microcontroller without the ability to program the processor directly. Instead, Blues provides an interface customers can use to configure and control the device externally using the supported USB, Serial, or I2C interfaces.<\/p>\r\n<p>To configure the device, you use a connected device to pass JSON messages to the Notecard through one of the supported interfaces. Firmware on the device parses the JSON messages and makes the appropriate local configuration changes or performs the necessary actions based on the contents of the JSON message.<\/p>\r\n<p>Using one of the Notecarriers, you can connect the Notecard to a computer using a USB cable the poke and prod the device with JSON messages over a command-line interface (CLI) or through a browser console. <br \/>There’s even Notecarrier devices for Adafruit Feather compatible devices and Raspberry Pi; with those devices you configure the Notecard using an I2C interface through your device’s custom code (which I’ll talk about a little later).<\/p>\r\n<p>The JSON API is very robust, offering a lot of different options for configuring the Notecard. I haven’t yet learned everything it can do, but you can configure how frequently the device wakes up to collect data and how frequently it sends the data over the network. You can even configure it to sleep periodically and how frequently it checks for new data to download over the network.<\/p>\r\n<p>I’m not going to describe all these options, you can find documentation for the capabilities here: <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.blues.io\/reference\/notecard-api\/card-requests\/.\">https:\/\/dev.blues.io\/reference\/notecard-api\/card-requests\/.<\/a> And for a complete tutorial on turning a Notecard into an asset tracker, refer to the Asset Tracking tutorial. <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.blues.io\/notecard\/notecard-guides\/asset-tracking\/\">https:\/\/dev.blues.io\/notecard\/notecard-guides\/asset-tracking\/<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now, if you want to do more with Notecard, this is where the I2C and Serial interfaces come in. You can connect the Notecard to any external computing device and send and receive JSON messages to and from the Notecard. Through this mechanism, the code running on the computing device can (and this is by no means a complete list):<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Send data to the Notecard<\/li>\r\n<li>Retrieve data from the Notecard<\/li>\r\n<li>Request data from remote data sources (3rd party APIs)<\/li>\r\n<li>Trigger sending queued data over the network connection<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>This is where the enormous power of the platform comes into play. Instead of forcing you to shoehorn your project needs into a custom microcontroller and network device, Blues lets you build your IoT project using any hardware and software you want, leveraging the Notecard to handle all data transfers and cellular connectivity.<\/p>\r\n<p>To make it even easier for developers to build prototype devices, Blues offers several Notecarrier devices. The simplest one is the Notecarrier B which offers a simple M.2 connector for the Notecard and pins you can use to connect the carrier to power abd other hardware devices (like a custom computing module). There’s also Notecarriers for the Adafruit Feather platform and Raspberry Pi, enabling you to plug in your own compatible hardware and interact with the Notecard using the Blues Wireless SDKs for the target device.<\/p>\r\n<p>Blues’ expectation is that you’ll prototype with the Notecarrier devices, then build custom hardware devices embedding the processor and other hardware (like sensors) with an M.2 connector for the Notecard. For hobbyists like me, the Notecarriers are perfect for building cool network connected devices into my projects.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now, at this point you may be asking yourself where does all of the data go? I’ll cover that topic in the next section.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Notehub<\/h2>\r\n<p>Cellular IoT projects are all about data - collecting data from remote locations and streaming the data to a central hub for processing. On the Blues Wireless platform, devices automatically send their data to projects defined in the Blues Wireless Notehub service.<\/p>\r\n<p>In Notehub you define Projects for every time of project you have running on the platform. When you configure a Notecard, you configure the Notehub project ID on the device so it knows where to send all of its data. <br \/>Recognizing that you’re going to want to do more with the data then simply store it on Notehub, Notehub offers a feature called Routes that enables you to process and forward the collected data to an external other system for further processing and\/or storage. I’ll dig deeper into how this works in subsequent articles; I have plans for a project and I’ll walk through every aspect of it as I put it together.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\r\n<p>As I mentioned in the beginning of the article, I’m a hobbyist and don’t work in the IoT space, so I can’t talk about the benefits of the Blues Wireless platform in large IoT deployments.<\/p>\r\n<p>Blues Wireless handles one of the most expensive and complicated parts of IoT: cellular data, offering a simple 10 year data plan for an unbelievable price. As I worked through the documentation and examples, I was pleased to see that every time I thought of something I wanted to do with the platform (like remotely executing code on a remote device like Particle does, and forwarding data out of Notehub to other services) there was a solution for it.<\/p>\r\n<p>Blues Wireless is a relatively new company but they really seem to have a lot of things figured out. They recently announced their own Feather compatible hardware device called the Swan. I have one on order and I’ll write about it once I get some time to play with it.<\/p>","state":"1","catid":"41","created":"2021-10-10 17:43:35","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2022-11-23 02:03:13","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2021-10-10 17:43:35","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/common\\\/technology-870.png\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/common\\\/technology-870.png\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"3","ordering":"0","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"1044","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"552","asset_id":"717","title":"Accurately Calculating Progress in Goodreads","alias":"accurately-calculating-progress-in-goodreads","introtext":"<p>I love writing utility applications; for many, many years I worked in the Enterprise space doing technology transitions and one of my favorite things was to write little pieces of code to solve problems big and small. For this blog post, the problem I’m dealing with is for a free app from Amazon called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/\">Goodreads<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>For years, Amazon had two social apps that allowed people to track the books they read: Shelfari and Goodreads. They eventually shut down Shelfari and merged everyone’s data into Goodreads. That saddened me because Shelfari was a much better app than Goodreads and delivered a more consistent experience across platforms. Goodreads delivers a different user experience (UX) on different platforms (browser, native mobile apps) and I really kinda hate it. I’ve gotten used to the android app user experience, but when I sometimes have to use a browser instead, I’m completely lost in completing some tasks.<\/p>\r\n<p>I use Goodreads because it lets me track how many books I read in a year (last year I read 68 books out of my goal of reading 50). It also allows me to see the books family and friends are reading, so it gives me great suggestions on what to pick up next. When I’m reading a book, Goodreads allows me to publish an update showing friends what I’m reading and how far into the book I am. The problem is that for many books, the information Goodreads uses to calculate percentage completion based on page number is inaccurate, making the progress value inaccurate as well.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n","fulltext":"\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>This happens because for some books, the pagecount data Goodreads has for some books is incorrect. This happens either because their source provides incorrect information or because there are multiple formats for a particular book which gives them different page counts. In some cases, I’ve seen places in Goodreads where I could pick a different publication for a particular book I’m reading, but I’ve not been able to find that particular area of the product in a while so I just give up.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Why Goodreads would have an incorrect page count makes no sense to me since Amazon knows everything there is to know about books sold through Amazon (where I usually get mine). Why Goodreads would hide the ability to let me pick the format\/edition of the book I’m trying to read is beyond me.<\/p>\r\n<p>The pagecount issue also rears its ugly head because of a more mundane problem. Many business, technical, historical, etc. books have indices and notes pages tacked on at the end which make any progress calculation inaccurate.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>For example, I just finished reading Undaunted Courage by Stephen Ambrose and according to Amazon and Goodreads, the book has 521 pages. In reality, the readable part of the book, the stuff that most of us would consider the meat of the book, is 484 pages.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>So, if I’m on page 100 of the book and I update Goodreads with that number, it calculates that I completed 19% of the book. In reality though I’ve completed 20% of the book. That’s not a huge difference, but it matters; some books have much larger indices so it matters more for them.<\/p>\r\n<p>After years of posting inaccurate progress percentages I decided to do something about it. I sat down and cranked out a quick application that takes the page number, actual page count, and total page count then spits out an adjusted value scaled to the total page count. You can find the application here: <a href=\"https:\/\/goodreads-page-adjuster.netlify.app\/\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/goodreads-page-adjuster.netlify.app\/\">https:\/\/goodreads-page-adjuster.netlify.app\/<\/a> and the source code for the project here: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/goodreads-page-adjuster\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/goodreads-page-adjuster\">https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/goodreads-page-adjuster<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>When you access the app, you’re prompted for the values shown in the image below. Enter the appropriate values for the book you’re reading and you’re all set. I added a copy button because I frequently do this on a mobile phone and I didn’t want to have to mess around with selecting and copying the resulting value.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"images\/stories\/2022\/goodreads-page-adjuster.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>As you can see, I’ve setup the parameters for Undaunted Courage. When I’m on actual page 100, for the Goodreads total page count that would be 107 pages. When I copy the value from here and paste it into Goodreads, Goodreads will show an actual progress percentage based on the total number of pages Goodreads thinks the book has.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>There’s nothing complicated about what I did here, but it was just some simple problem I wanted to solve using code. Enjoy.<\/p>","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2022-01-09 21:45:52","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2022-11-23 02:02:40","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2022-01-09 21:45:52","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/common\\\/code-870.png\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/common\\\/code-870.png\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"4","ordering":"3","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"863","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

The Joomla team recently released Joomla 4 and Joomla 3 will reach end of life next year. As I started working through the Joomla 3 to Joomla 4 upgrade process, I realized that my site was broken and I couldn’t get any help from my ISP.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 8px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">With that in mind, I started thinking about how I could easily migrate all of my existing article content to another CMS. I’m experienced (a bit) with Jekyll and have always wanted to learn more about Eleventy (11ty). I definitely didn’t want to do all of the article conversion myself, so I started thinking about how to build a tool to do all of it for me.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 8px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">I knew Jekyll uses markdown files and Eleventy supports them as well, so I decided to convert my content to markdown thinking that with the right conversion template, I could migrate my site’s articles to almost any CMS.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 8px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">I’ve published several node CLI modules in the past (for managing Jekyll assets and to simplify the Moddable CLI), so I decided I’d build this one in Node as well. I recently learned about the Open CLI Framework (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/oclif.io\/\">https:\/\/oclif.io\/<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">) and wanted a chance to learn that framework.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 8px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The result of all of this is that I recently published a node module called Joomla to Markdown (joomla-to-markdown) available at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/joomla-to-markdown\">https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/joomla-to-markdown<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 8px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">To use this module, export your Joomla site’s Categories and Content tables to JSON files using MySQL Admin (or similar tool). Then, with a couple of simple terminal commands you can parse the article and category content and output a separate markdown file for each article in the Joomla site.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 8px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">I built the module so it uses a user-defined template file to define the format of the markdown file and allows you to add any field from the Joomla site’s Content table to the markdown file. Its all pretty simple to use and available today.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 8px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">I wrote the module to be completely command-line driven, where the user provides the parameters the module needs to operate on the command line, but it got tedious typing them in all the time. I’m currently working on an enhancement to the module which uses a local configuration file to run the process (as an alternative workflow) so you can tweak the template and quickly rerun the export without typing all sorts of command line options. I’ll have that version of the module published after the US Thanksgiving holiday (2022).<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 8px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">I hopped back into my Joomla site and after making some tweaks was able to get it back up and running - hence my ability to publish this article. This probably won’t last long, I’m going to redeploy this site on Jekyll first then Eleventy once I’ve got everything I want to do figured out. Stay tuned, I know I’ll write about the experience once I do it.<\/span><\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"9","created":"2022-11-23 02:00:29","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2023-02-20 14:30:48","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2022-11-23 02:00:29","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/common\\\/code-870.png\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"images\\\/stories\\\/common\\\/code-870.png\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"3","ordering":"1","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"197","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
{"id":"557","asset_id":"726","title":"Synchronizing CircuitPython Files","alias":"synchronizing-circuitpython-files","introtext":"<p><br \/>I love working with a variety of microcontroller devices and a lot of my projects use LEDs, so I was pleasantly surprised when the folks at Adafruit added the FeatherS2 Neo (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/product\/5629\">https:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/product\/5629<\/a>) board to their catalog. It has an ESP32 processor and a 5x5 grid of little NeoPixels onboard, so it is perfect for some of my projects.<\/p>\r\n<p>The board comes configured to use CircuitPython (<a href=\"https:\/\/circuitpython.org\/\">https:\/\/circuitpython.org\/<\/a>) by default, although you can also program it in C in the Arduino IDE. I haven’t done much CircuitPython work in the past, so I thought I’d learn more about it as I worked with the board. I’ll publish some of my projects for it as I progress, but this article is about the CircuitPython development workflow and a tool I created to tweak that workflow to suit my particular needs.<\/p>\r\n<p>When you connect a CircuitPython (CP) device to a computer using a USB cable, the CP device manifests itself as a connected drive. On my Windows development system, due to all of the other drives I have connected to it, the CP device appears as drive H. On the macOS system, where I’m writing this article, it appears as \/Volumes\/CIRCUITPY.<\/p>\r\n<p>Developer tooling reads and writes directly to\/from the ‘drive’ to deploy executable code to the device (in this case, written in the CP variant of Python). There are even Python editing tools like Mu (<a href=\"https:\/\/codewith.mu\/\">https:\/\/codewith.mu\/<\/a>) or extensions for popular editors like Visual Studio Code (<a href=\"https:\/\/marketplace.visualstudio.com\/items?itemName=joedevivo.vscode-circuitpython\">https:\/\/marketplace.visualstudio.com\/items?itemName=joedevivo.vscode-circuitpython<\/a>) that understands how to interact with connected CP devices. The developer connects the device and opens an editor and codes away. The tooling I mentioned also provides additional capabilities that assists with monitoring and debugging an application as it runs on the CP device.<\/p>\r\n<p>This approach works great for new developers and classroom environments. All the learner has to do is plugin the device, open an editor, and away they go. As the learner moves from classroom to home, all of the code they need is already on the device, they can edit it anywhere they want then unplug the device and take it with them.<\/p>\r\n<p>I’m used to a different development workflow.<\/p>\r\n<p>In modern development workflows, developers work in a local code project (in a project folder on a local hard drive) or in the cloud (accessed using a browser-based editor for example). In that workflow, changes to the project’s code are tracked and managed through a version control system like Git and synchronized between development systems through a cloud repository like GitHub. When working with a microcontroller or single board computer, I’m used to coding in my local project folder and deploying code to the device when it's ready to run on the device. As I complete features, I commit them to the version control system and push them to the cloud for sharing.<\/p>\r\n<p>What I want to do is use this type of Git-based workflow with the CP device.<\/p>\r\n<p>I could create a git repository on the connected CP Device, code away on the device and commit my changes to the repository on the device then synchronize that device-side repository to the cloud. That would work, but this is still very device-focused; the primary storage location for my code is the device, not my local development system.<\/p>\r\n<p>Another option is to code locally, then copy the files to the CP device. This could be a simple shell\/command script and would work, but the CP-aware editors expect to read\/write to\/from the device, so that would eliminate those types of tools from my toolbelt.<\/p>\r\n<p>What I decided to do instead is leave the development workflow like it is, use the CP-aware tools that expect to interact directly with the connected device and copy the code to my local project folder. I could create a local folder for the project code, set up a Git repository in the folder, then copy the code files from the CP device periodically as I work on the project. I could implement this as a simple script, all I’d have to do is make sure I ran it whenever I had new code to copy.<br \/>Rather than write a script or copy a script into every project, I decided to create a tool I could use in any project and share with others to use with their projects as well.<\/p>\r\n<p>The tool I created is a node-based command-line module called CircuitPython Sync (cpsync), you can access the code on GitHub (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/circuitpython-sync\">https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/circuitpython-sync<\/a>) and install it on your development systems using Node Package Manager (npm) (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/cpsync\">https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/cpsync<\/a>).<\/p>\r\n<p>I wrote it in NodeJS because I have a lot of experience using node in many of my other projects and it's a standard part of many modern software development workflows. I expect I’ll someday rewrite it as a standalone executable using Rust. <br \/>To use the tool, you open a terminal window (macOS or Linux) or command prompt (Windows) and execute the `cpsync` command (passing in the correct arguments, of course - all describe on the Gthub or NPM pages) and it will setup a file change listener on the CP device. Then, with that running, use the CircuitPython editor of choice to modify the code on the device. Every time you save a change to an existing file, create a new file, or delete a file on the device, cpsync copies, creates, or deletes the file in the designated project folder. You can see an example of cpsync in action in the following figure.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2023\/cp-sync-1.png\" alt=\"cpsync terminal window\" width=\"640\" height=\"342\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>In this example, the tool synchronizes CP files from drive H:\\ to my project folder in c:\\Users\\john\\dev\\cp-project\\. The CP device has a lot of extra files on it that aren’t generally used or accessed by a developer, so in the example I used a command-line flag (-i for ignore) that tells cpsync to ignore (not synchronize) the unnecessary files.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, when this runs, my local project folder will only contain the lib folder plus the code.py and feather2neo.py files updated with the latest changes every time those changes are written to the CP device. If I added a new file or folder, those would automatically synchronize to the local project folder. If I deleted a file or folder, those changes would reflect in the local project folder within a few seconds.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n<figure data-wf-figure=\"1\"><img src=\"images\/stories\/2023\/cp-sync-2.png\" alt=\"Windows Explorer Project Folder\" \/><figcaption>Synchronized Project<\/figcaption><\/figure>\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>This tool allows me to use the workflow and tooling that works best for me when working with a CircuitPython device.

{"id":"558","asset_id":"727","title":"Displaying Build Details in an Eleventy Site","alias":"displaying-build-details-in-an-eleventy-site","introtext":"<p>I recently started using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.11ty.dev\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Eleventy<\/a>, a node-based static site generator and quickly put up a new site using it. With that under my belt, I migrated my <a href=\"https:\/\/randomerrors.dev\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Random Errors<\/a> site from Jekyll to Eleventy pretty quickly. My long term plan is to migrate this site from Joomla to Eleventy as soon as I figure out a couple of extra features I need for this site’s migration.<\/p>\r\n<p>In the meantime, I will share my learnings along the way.<\/p>\r\n<p>As I played around with the Random Errors site during the migration, I realized I wanted to be able to show the site’s build date in the footer. Not because it was necessary to do so, but because I wanted to figure out how to do it in Eleventy.<\/p>\r\n<p>Since Eleventy is a static site generator, you can simply write the current date\/time to the appropriate pages at generation time. Using Liquid, this is pretty easy:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>This page was last updated at {{ \"now\" | date: \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\" }}.<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>If you have a large site, and it takes a long time to generate all the pages (more than a minute for example), I imagine you could see different times on different pages because of that processing, but that’s something I didn’t validate. I’m not sure if Eleventy parses templates once then uses a cached version during site generation or whether it parses it every time.<\/p>\r\n<p>I know that over time I’m going to add new features to the site, updates to the site’s structure or capabilities rather than just publishing new articles, how can I display platform build information on the site?<\/p>\r\n<p>Since Eleventy is node-based, Eleventy projects have a `package.json` file that contains a build number in its `version` property. Here’s the file contents from the Random Errors site:<\/p>\r\n<pre class=\"language-json\"><code>{\r\n\"name\": \"random-errors-11ty\",\r\n\"version\": \"0.0.3\",\r\n\"description\": \"\",\r\n\"scripts\": {\r\n\"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" &amp;&amp; exit 1\"\r\n},\r\n\"author\": \"John M. Wargo\",\r\n\"repository\": {\r\n\"type\": \"git\",\r\n\"url\": \"https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/random-errors-11ty\"\r\n},\r\n\"license\": \"MIT\",\r\n\"devDependencies\": {\r\n\"@11ty\/eleventy\": \"^2.0.0\",\r\n\"@11ty\/eleventy-plugin-rss\": \"^1.2.0\",\r\n\"@11ty\/eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlight\": \"^4.2.0\"\r\n},\r\n\"keywords\": []\r\n}<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>That means I can use the `version` property along with the date\/time that the version number was updated and display that data as my platform version and timestamp in the site. Let me show you how I did that.<\/p>\r\n<p>In Eleventy projects, you can create data files in the project’s `_data` folder and the site generator will automatically load the file’s contents as a data set named with the data file’s root file name (the part before the dot and file extension). So, as described in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.11ty.dev\/docs\/data-global\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Global Data Files<\/a> in the Eleventy documentation, if I create a JSON file in the `_data` folder with the package version and a date\/time stamp, I can automatically access the data as Eleventy generates the static site files.<\/p>\r\n<p>I could just add a `buildDate` property to the site’s `package.json` file and copy that file into the `_data` folder every time I generate a new version of the site’s files. But I’m an automation guy, so I knew there had to be a better way.<\/p>\r\n<p>The npm CLI exposes the `<a href=\"https:\/\/docs.npmjs.com\/cli\/v9\/commands\/npm-version\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">npm version<\/a>` command that allows you to automatically update the version number in the `package.json` file. I can use that to increment the `version` property automatically during the build process.<\/p>\r\n<p>Update the `scripts` section of the `package.json` file and add a `build` section as shown below:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>\"build\": \"npm version patch &amp;&amp; eleventy\",<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>When you’re ready to do a new build of the site, open a terminal window or command prompt and execute the following command:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>npm run build<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>At this point, npm updates the version number in the `package.json` file (represented by the v0.0.4` shown in the output below. Next, the Eleventy site generator kicks in and generates the site’s files as shown below (with most of the site’s pages omitted).<\/p>\r\n<p><code>D:\\dev\\11ty\\random-errors&gt;npm run build<br \/>&gt; <a href=\"mailto:random-errors-11ty@0.0.3\">random-errors-11ty@0.0.3<\/a> build<br \/>&gt; npm version patch &amp;&amp; eleventy<br \/>v0.0.4<br \/>[11ty] Writing _site\/algolia.json from .\/src\/algolia.liquid<br \/>[11ty] Writing _site\/feed.xml from .\/src\/feed.njk<br \/>[11ty] Writing _site\/about\/index.html from .\/src\/about.md (liquid)<br \/>.<br \/>.<br \/>.<br \/>[11ty] Writing _site\/posts\/2021\/firebase-hosting-google-domains-subdomain\/index.html from .\/src\/posts\/2021\/firebase-hosting-google-domains-subdomain.md (liquid)<br \/>[11ty] Writing _site\/posts\/2021\/firebase-hosting-google-domains\/index.html from .\/src\/posts\/2021\/firebase-hosting-google-domains.md (liquid)<br \/>[11ty] Copied 46 files \/ Wrote 33 files in 15.34 seconds (464.8ms each, v2.0.0)<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>That gets me an updated version number for my site, but doesn’t help me put the data I need (the version number plus the build timestamp) into the site’s `_data` folder.<\/p>\r\n<p>Since Eleventy is a npm-based static site generator and I like to write node-based command-line utilities, I realized I could build a little utility that took care of building the data file I needed, even copying the file to the `_data` folder in my site.<\/p>\r\n<p>The utility is called Generate Build Info and you can find it on npm at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/generate-build-info.\">https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/generate-build-info.<\/a> What it does is read the `version` property of the current project’s `package.json` file, then writes a `buildinfo.json` file to a folder you specify containing the build details for the project:<\/p>\r\n<pre class=\"language-json\"><code>{\r\n\"buildVersion\": \"0.0.2\",\r\n\"buildDateMs\": 1678725607879,\r\n\"buildDateStr\": \"3\/13\/2023, 12:40:07 PM\"\r\n}<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>The `buildVersion` property is the `version` property from the `package.json` file, and the `buildDate` properties are the current time in two different formats you can use in your Eleventy site: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Unix_time\">Milliseconds since Epoch<\/a> or a date\/time string.<\/p>\r\n<p>To use it, open a terminal window or command prompt in your eleventy project’s root folder and execute the following command:<\/p>\r\n<p><code>npm install generate-build-info --save-dev<\/code><\/p>\r\n<p>This adds the utility to the project’s development dependencies (you don’t need it at runtime); you’ll use `gen-build-info` to generate the data file. With that in place, update the `package.json` build command like this:<\/p>\r\n<pre class=\"language-json\"><code>\"scripts\": {\r\n\"build\": \"npm version patch &amp;&amp; gen-build-info src\/_data &amp;&amp; eleventy\"\r\n},<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>In this example, my _data folder is in the project’s src folder, so I want the utility to put the data file there. When you execute the `npm run build` command again, it updates the project’s npm patch version, generates the `buildinfo.json` file and copies it to the `src\/_data` folder, then executes an Eleventy site generation. Easy peasy.<\/p>\r\n<p>In your Eleventy project, Eleventy automatically makes the `buildinfo.json` file available to the application as `buildinfo`, so referring to the data file and properties is as easy as:<\/p>\r\n<pre class=\"language-markup\"><code>&lt;p&gt;Version {{ buildinfo.buildVersion }}, Deployed {{ buildinfo.buildDateStr }}&lt;\/p&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>When you look at the site, you’ll see this in the footer of every page:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/stories\/2023\/random-errors-footer.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"39\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>I built this with the understanding that I would run this process locally on my development workstation. Once the process updates the package version and writes the JSON file, I can just commit the files to my local repo and synchronize them with the cloud. My hosting site, in this case <a href=\"https:\/\/www.netlify.com\/\">Netlify<\/a> picks up the changes, generates the site (again), and publishes it.<\/p>\r\n<p>I set it up this way because I don’t want to change the package version when I publish a new post. I only want to update the build information when I make changes to the platform (my Eleventy App), and that means I’m perfectly happy doing this manually when I need it.<\/p>\r\n<p>What I should do, and I’m going to make that change now, is setup my builds so I have a platform build and a new article build like this:<\/p>\r\n<pre class=\"language-json\"><code>\"scripts\": {\r\n\"pbuild\": \"npm version patch &amp;&amp; gen-build-info src\/_data &amp;&amp; eleventy\",\r\n\"build\": \"eleventy\"\r\n},<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>If you wanted to run all of this in the cloud, you could probably do this in GitHub Actions or some other CI\/CD process running in the cloud. The issue is that the package version update requires committing the changes it makes to Git, and cloud hosting providers won’t be able to do that without using continuous delivery which understands committing code to a repository. This is not my area of expertise, so I’m going to stop talking now.<\/p>\r\n<p>Some implementation notes:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Your Eleventy project won’t automatically have a data folder, so you must set that up first. Start by adding the folder to wherever you put your Eleventy project source files, then remember to update the project’s `eleventy.js` file to copy the data folder to the generated site: eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy(\"src\/_data\/*\");<\/li>\r\n<li>If you think you did everything right and your site doesn’t have the `buildinfo.json` file, make sure you refer to the previous bullet.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","fulltext":"","state":"1","catid":"8","created":"2023-03-15 21:44:05","created_by":"62","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2023-03-18 09:22:38","modified_by":"62","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2023-03-15 21:44:05","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}","urls":"{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}","attribs":"{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}","version":"6","ordering":"1","metakey":"","metadesc":"","access":"1","hits":"76","metadata":"{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}","featured":"1","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},

In that tutorial, Ray generates a separate categories page for each category, then links to the category page from the list of categories on each Post. That’s an excellent feature, and I wanted that for my site, but I also want to present users with a stand-alone list of categories they can browse directly from the site’s home page.<\/p>\r\n<p>To do that with Ray’s tutorial, I made a few changes. FIrst of all, I renamed the `categories.liquid` page to `category.liquid` then updated all references to it in the site (basically updating the `post.liquid` include.<\/p>\r\n<p>Next, I added a new `categories.liquid` page with the following Liquid code:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;View all of the posts for a particular category by <br \/>clicking on one of the categories listed below.

As part of that process, I followed Raymond Camden’s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.raymondcamden.com\/2020\/06\/24\/adding-algolia-search-to-eleventy-and-netlify\">Adding Algolia Search to Eleventy and Netlify<\/a> to offer search for the site.<\/p>\r\n<p>In the article, Ray suggests hosting an Eleventy site on Netlify and using Netlify Functions update merge Algolia Index updates with the cloud. However, he expressed concerns about the time limit on Netlify Functions executions and the potential impact on larger sites. When I get to migrating this site, I don’t have nearly the number of posts that Ray has, but I don’t want to monitor the process to ensure the index update works.<\/p>\r\n<p>I’m likely going to build and test any changes I make on the site locally, so I built a node-based command-line utility I’ll use to update my index. I took the example code from Ray’s article and packaged it in a simple node packageI can add as a development dependency in my sites and automate the index update. The package is called Algolia Index Update, and you can find it on <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/johnwargo\/algolia-index-update\">GitHub<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/algolia-index-update\">npmjs.org<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>I just realized that I made a mistake in the package. To enable it to work locally as well as a build task in a cloud hosting site, I store the index name and secret Algolia API keys in environment variables. As soon as I have more than one Eleventy site using Algolia, that’s going to break. I’ll have to update to store the index name locally with the site, perhaps in the package.json file or pass the index name on the command line.
