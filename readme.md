# John Wargo (Eleventy)

The static site generated version of johnwargo.com, implemented using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).

I haven't even started on this thorny beast, but created this repository to track tasks.

* [ ] Implement core 11ty project
* [ ] Select template and implement (elemental, faction, )
* [ ] Copy posts to project
* [ ] Copy image files to project
* [ ] Section - Publications (books, articles, etc. from johnwargobooks.com)
* [ ] Section - Code projects (from johnwargo.dev)
* [ ] Section - Related Sites (all of the other sites I maintain)
* [ ] Add Buy Me a Coffee
* [ ] Add site search using, I think, Algolia
* [ ]
