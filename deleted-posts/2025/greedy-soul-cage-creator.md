title: Greedy Soul Cage Creator
description: Describes my interaction with a Hackster.io creator who published what appears to be an amazing Halloween project, but won't distribute the project source code until after Halloween. Offering instead to sell it to me before then.

While browsing my phone's news feed yesterday, I noticed an article about an amazing Halloween project: [This creepy ESP32 "soul pendant" is the perfect accessory for Halloween](https://www.xda-developers.com/creepy-esp32-soul-pendant-halloween/){target="_blank"}. My twins were born close to Halloween, so its always been a big deal for them, especially my daughter.

I quickly jumped to the article: [SoulCage - the Digital Trapped Soul Pendant](https://www.hackster.io/Vishalsoniindia/soulcage-the-digital-trapped-soul-pendant-598265){target="_blank"} and poked around and thought it would be an amazing project to build for my daughter.

When I got to my desk, I opened the project's code repository to start analyzing the code and planning for deployment and, potentially, customizations. When I got there, I realized that there was no code at all. Hmm, well, the author found some bugs but the code would be up there soon (I assumed). I thought that was weird, but I was willing to wait a bit and see what happened.

Notice the wink? fixing some bugs? Wink! wink!

Checking back this morning, I noticed that there was a message offering me an option for early access to the code. Poking around in the repository I notice that the code was never actually published to the repository. So this author never actually shared the project code with anyone. They published the project to Hackster.io but not the actual project code.

Anyway, I sent off a quick email asking for access to the code. This is what I received back:

{% image "src/images/2025/soul-cage-05.png", "", "image-full" %}

An offer to sell me the binary:

```text
I’m planning to release the firmware after Halloween.

If you want early access, I’m selling the binary and the code upload setup for $20.
```

After Halloween? The whole point of anyone wanting to build this project is to have it available to them before Halloween. This project creator seems to have no interest in making this project available to anyone unless he profits off it.

{% image "src/images/2025/soul-cage-05.png", "", "image-full" %}

```text
Sure, you can get access to it by paying for it.
Let me know what your budget is.
I’ve reduced the price to $13 for the binary files, which can be directly uploaded to the ESP32-S3.

what fo you think about it?
```

I think that I won't be building this project. I cancelled my hardware order and moved on.

I noticed that the author has a **Buy me a Coffee** link on their project and would have been happy to toss $20US their way for what looked like an amazing project. But to hold the code hostage and demand payment is not the way to build a name for yourself and support the maker community.

Too bad, the project looked cool.

## What Are My Issue With This?

Certainly not that the author wants to make money off of his creation. It probably was a lot of work and if he wants paid for it, he should be paid. 

Unfortunately, the author makes no mention of wanting money for the source code or even compiled binary in the project description (that I could find anyway). Most visitors on Hackster.io expect full access to the project resources while Hackster.io offers for fee projects on [Hackster Pro](https://www.hackster.io/pro){target="_blank"}. 

My issue is that he published the project on Hackster.io and referred to the project's GitHub repository which indicates that the code is freely available. Its not. The code isn't even there even though the project refers to it being there. 

My other issue is that the author lies in the project repository's `readme.md` file: "Coming Soon (fixing some bugs for you ;-))". Well, it's not necessarily a lie, the code is coming, just not soon. Its coming AFTER Halloween even though most of us only care about it before Halloween. He's offering to make the code free to all of us, but only after he gets as much money out of it as possible this Halloween season. That's fine, but that approach doesn't work for me. When I write code and publish it online, its always free; that's what it means to be a part of the community.

He is likely lying in the "fixing some bugs" statement since he's willing to send me a compiled binary for $20, so what bugs could be there if it works enough to sell it to me?
